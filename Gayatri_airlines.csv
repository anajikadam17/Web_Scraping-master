Generally the inflight service they provide is pretty great. Friendly flight attendants, good meals, etc. The problems crop up before or after the flight. Starting with the ticket purchase process - at some point I was able to choose the seat when purchasing even the cheapest tickets, but that's not the case anymore. Now you can pay more upfront to get the seat option, pay for an ""upgrade"" while checking in, or just get assigned a random seat after check in.  I've almost exclusively flown American since moving to the US, and one thing that happens pretty consistently is baggage space. When boarding almost every flight, they will announce the overhead bins are full so passengers (in the last few groups) are either ""forced"" to check-in their carryons or use bins from 5 rows behind their seat, thus blocking the (ridiculously narrow) path and making the boarding process even more chaotic than it already is. And lastly, the reason I even took the effort to write this, customer support (or lack of). If you ever need to call AA for anything, be prepared to speak Robot in order to navigate its futuristic AI conversation engine. And it may seem like it's meant to keep you from speaking to an actual human, but at least it accepts voice input, and what more can I ask from my airline of choice?

These flights that we have previously paid for months in advance, are usually cancelled or postponed, especially on the return flights.

However, I will avoid flying with this airline in the future for the following reasons: 1) Seating. They will not seat you with your family or friends unless you purchased this option. You will likely be separated from them, even if you purchased tickets at the same time. 2) No online check-in. Despite the terms saying that you can check-in online 24 hours prior to flying (where you supposedly can arrange seats on international flights), this is not allowed for international flights. I attempted to log-in multiple times the day before flying and calling the airline, but wait times were over an hour. I spoke to other passengers who also were unable to check-in online before the flight and this experience was the same. 3) The food is not good. I ordered the Asian-vegetarian meal in advance which normally means on the Atlantic US flights that you'll get Indian food. The rice was undercooked and it was so incredibly spicy my stomach hurt. 4) The flight attendants weren't working. Despite my positive interactions with the flight attendants, I saw them taking a lot of breaks. The airline had blocked the entire back middle row (4 seats across). I understand they need breaks, however, I have never seen flight attendants reading and watching films. Shouldn't these seats be available to the passengers? Not once did I see them walking around offering beverages during the pauses in between meals. 5) The seats are awful. I got stuck in the seat in front of the bathroom on the side. This seat barely reclines and the seat in front of me was broken and the woman left her seat reclined the entire time, so I was unable to properly view the screen or have much space to move.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to London via Los Angeles,January 2020,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,2,Recommendedno

Traveling to Ecuador from Phoenix through a connection in Dallas with my husband to see my sick father in-law. First we arrived to the airport in Phoenix super early just in case there was long lines but checkin went very smooth but after that everything went wrong. As we are waiting for the flight we get multiple notifications that our flight is being delayed. After the fourth delay notification we went to customer service to see what the issue was and if we were going to make our international connection. After talking to them for a while, we found out the plane was late leaving LA due to a baggage problem and after them contacting the POC it was decided to try the flight to Dallas in hopes that for some reason the our international flight was delayed, due to the time of year, that we might be able to make it and if not we were told that they would rebook us to the next flight, which was the following night, and they would get us a hotel on them. We tried and took the delayed flight to Dallas on their recommendation. Unfortunately we missed our international flight so we went to customer service now in Dallas as we were told to do in Phoenix and were told that they were going to give us nothing! The customer service employee was the rudest, least helpful person I have every met. She said that the flight was delayed due to bad weather in Phoenix (which was not true plus we were told it was a baggage problem in LA that caused the delay) and that since it was a weather problem they are not responsible to give us anything. We explained to her what we were told in Phoenix that if we missed the flight due to their delay we would get a hotel and meal vouchers since the next flight to Ecuador was not for another 24 hours. She told us it was not her problem and that she could give us a number to call for discounted rates for a hotel or send us back to Phoenix. So now my husband and I are stuck in Dallas for 24 hours with nothing. Not even our bags because since our final destination was not Dallas the bags were put in a storage room to be put on the Ecuador flight the next evening. We left the terminal basically in tears because we dont have any money for a hotel or anything because we have been scraping and saving money for this trip. We went to the baggage people to see if by chance we could get our bags to at least change clothes or brush our teeth since everything was in our checked bags. The workers there were very nice and said that is was not right and sent us to another person who eventually gave us a hotel and meal voucher. Our flight from Phoenix landed at 6:00pm. The missed flight to Ecuador took off at 5:35pm. By the time anything got resolved and after being sent to different people, we got a hotel at 1:00am. The other people we talked to, baggage claim and eventually upper management were all very nice and understanding, but Charo, who's title is customer service was less then worthless and rude. All we wanted was what were we told we would get after taking their recommendation to still take that flight instead of being rerouted another way.

While there, we purchased new luggage. When we got home, one of the new pieces had one of the wheels  broken off. We went to baggage claims and they told us they would start a claim but did not think this one could be fixed. She was very nice and offered a replacement bag for us to get our stuff home in one piece and suggested we call when we get home. We did and at first, they told us we accepted a replacement piece so that closed the case. The brand new piece we purchased was almost $400 and they replaced it with a piece you could get on Amazon for $69. I told them this was unacceptable. She said she would have to speak with a supervisor and would get back to us the next day. I never heard back from them. So after a week, I called them back. Was told the person handling my claim was not there but took a message and said she would call back when she was in at work the next day. Again, no return phone call. I waited another week and still no call from them. I finally called them back and spoke to someone else. He also told me that I had accepted a new bag and the case was closed. I explained everything again and said that was unacceptable. He said he would talk with a manager and call me back. No return call. I called him back after a day or two and he said the manager agreed to pay for a replacement bag and he was sending me an email. In the email, it said I needed to send them a copy of the receipt. I did that right after I read their email. A few days later, I got another email saying they were sending me a check for the $389 replacement cost but had to return the bag they gave me to the airport. I drove an hour and forty minutes one way to return the bag they gave me. It took almost an hour to convince the people at the airport to accept the replacement bag back. I then had to call them again to ensure the system showed I returned it. A day later later I called again and they just sent me an email saying they were sending a check. I called again and asked why it was only for the $389 and not for the set they destroyed and what about the tax I paid. He said they do not reimburse for those things and the case was closed.

We had bought separate tickets on 2 consecutive days, but mine ended up being economy and my husband + baby, premium economy. Both for basically the same price for the round-trip flights ($1348.83 for economy vs $1366.16 for premium economy). When we boarded, the economy class was packed, not a seat open. However, the premium economy was practically empty, only 5 other passengers. The seat next to my husband (baby was a lap infant) was open, because the woman assigned to it quickly changed to a different seat (nodbody wants to sit next to a baby, right?). So as the seat became open, I went and sat there, and immediately the flight attendant went to get a supervisor to scold me. The two woman ganged up on me and yelled at me, accusing me of having kicked out the other lady from her seat. I thought, what are these lies? They very meanly told me to go sit at my regular seat, 20 rows back. I obeyed, but after reaching 10000 ft of altitude I communicated my situtation to another flight attendant, to see if they could understand that I am a mother who has been separated from her baby and husband. They were very mean. They again yelled at me saying that you have to pay for that class, $500 or $800 (two people told me 2 different things). How ironic that the prices we paid for these two different classes were the same! Also, I bet that, had I been their ""friend"" or sister, the treatment would have been different. So then my husband called the manager, and very politely conveyed our situation and asked why couldn't I be with them, if there were tons of open seats available. He first said “I hear that you’ve had an encounter with all my staff”. Ok, first off, “an encounter?” Asking questions is “an encounter”?! Second, aren't the staff there to help customers? Doesn’t American Airlines always say that they are there to serve you and make your flight great? Then he said that it was the regulation, but yet, he was willing to break the regulations by letting me take my baby with me to my seat, even though he was *not* the lap infant associated with my ticket. Oh, so we break one rule, the one about swapping seats and tickets for the child, but not the rule about moving ""up"" on a seating class (barely, still economy)? While this was happening, the seat belt sign was off, so I had left my seat to go see my family. The meal time also began. The two flight attendants who had previously yelled at me in a 2-against-1 scenario, now attacked me again. ""Go back to your seat!"" ""You can't be here!"".

On 12/2/19, my 9 yo daughter was traveling from Madrid>DFW>SFO. I get a call at 11pm PST stating that she cannot check in due to the unaccompanied minor fee not being paid. When I booked this flight it was mandatory that both unaccompanied minor fees were paid for both ways. While on the phone with the agent she confirmed both ways were paid. Unfortunately when I was sent my trip confirmation unaccompanied minor doesn’t show up on that. After receiving the phone call I immediately called the airline to fix this problem and was told that somehow the system must have dropped the unaccompanied minor for the trip back. At that time I offered to pay this fee and was told that they could not take my payment over the phone! So here I have my 9yo daughter in Spain and I can’t pay for her to get here. I suggested that this fee be waived since this was American Airlines fault, the agent also mentioned that should could not do this as well.  Thank god a stranger ended up paying for her unaccompanied minor fee at the gate in Spain. If this very generous person didn’t take care of this my child would be stuck alone in a foreign country.  My daughter gets to DFW at 1:35PM. Her next flight is scheduled to leave DFW at 4:49. After 13 delays the new time to depart is 11:05PM. 10 hours she is sitting in the airport and during this time she was not in the unaccompanied minor room, they had her sitting in the gate area alone. I had called the gate multiple times to make sure she was ok and that someone there had fed her. I was told she was fed a cookie, chips and some soda, she was NOT fed a hot meal. I then asked where she was and was told she was asleep in a chair next to the gate! My 9yo was left in the main area and not in the unaccompanied minor room where she should have been. At this point I finally get a hold of a manager who apologized for everything and took my daughter to get a hot meal and back to the UM room. (7 hours too late). In addition my daughter was mingling with people at the gate and even ate with some random family. Coco was the only amazing thing about this trip home for my daughter. No one called me to update me, no one tried to get this 9yo on another flight to another nearby airport. I looked up the other flights and plenty went out before flight 2393 I am beyond livid .

We agreed and just as she was getting our information the call was interrupted by an automated message asking if I would work with that representative again. I was then thanked and the call was ended without tickets. I called AA again while I was in line and in 45 min I was on the line again with a representative. I explained that my husband had gotten frustrated with what had become over a two-hour wait to get a flight home and had purchased a returning flight through Delta Airlines the next morning. I asked her if she could book us on a different airline and she said that there were no flights available. I asked her if we should cancel the flights that we have booked through Delta so that she could book those flights through Delta for us and she said there was no way that she could guarantee that she could get those tickets if we canceled them and that we should just keep those tickets and get a refund on those Delta tickets from AA. I asked her if she could get us a hotel. She said there was really nothing else she could do. As we were exiting the terminal to get our checked bags visiting with some of the other passengers we were told that they were given hotel vouchers for a nearby hotel. We decided to return to the customer service people and see if we could get a room as well but no one was there.

I was in NYC getting 2nd opinions on recurrent stage 4 cancer. The weather got bad on my way back home and our plane never left runway. We were all bussed back to the airport and shoves in a small room as they tried to figure out alternate routes. It was disappointing they couldn’t get me home until 11pm the following night due to both NYC airports shutting down so it was a mess. The nice man at the rebooking booth knew it was way too long for someone in my condition to wait it out in an airport as it would be almost 24 hours. He offered me a food credit, 2 shuttle credits, and 2 nights at a hotel he told me was within 2 miles if LaGuardia. Food credit worked great and I got food before I left for the shuttle. I then waited outside in the pouring rain as the shuttle just wasn’t coming even after an hour. Finally I see it and make sure to get on first. It was at that time the driver asked to see the credit and he said okay hop in. Let’s get you to the Bronx! The Bronx I said? It’s true they booked all of use in the hurtle in a Comfort Inn in the Bronx much further than 2 miles. I was just happy to be going to a room as I was beginning to feel weak and tired. I hopped off the bus first and ran in when we got there. This was pure intuition. I walk in and explain and show my vouchers only to be told they don’t take airline vouchers as the rest of the entire shuttle lines up behind me. She called 3 managers on speaker phone and they all said they don’t take them Nor were they notified by American Airlines. So it’s storming and this lobby is full of upset people. They were about to get more upset when the woman tells us all they only have 3 rooms total available for everyone and you must pay for it. I paid for that night and the next day since they refused to take my two vouchers and the next day as my flight was 10pm. It was $175 a night. The next day they end up changing my flight twice so I could longer use my voucher for the shuttle as they didn’t allow me enough time with the last second flight change to sooner take off. Now I had to pay $43 for an uber ride to the airport because they moved the flight back up last second to try and get out before a storm. I did all of this as I had no help and no choice.

A month went by and I get a simple email saying that there had been a change to our itinerary, but they didn't charge us any extra money. I go to look at our new flight schedules and AA had the nerve to double our layover time to 20 hours in Phoenix and add another layover on the way home in Charlotte, with 20 minutes between landing and takeoff to change planes in Charlotte. This makes two layovers now on the trip home. All the changes meant we were literally traveling for a total of 30 hours all together (for a flight that is barely 6 hours nonstop). We had previously booked and paid for lodging in Oakland for our flight in, and with the new itinerary change we would have been forced to cancel. I was finally fed up and called AA, who was very pleasant on the phone and they couldn't believe how drastically our schedule was changed and assured a full refund (which I have received). We re-booked with Southwest, nonstop both ways for less than $150 more. Well worth the extra money in my opinion.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Oakland,December 2019,,,,,,,1,Recommendedno

Our trip started out flying from Los Angeles (LAX) to Dallas (DFW), then onto Paris (CDG), then to Munich (MUN) for Oktoberfest. The flight from LAX to DFW was ok which is the only reason I gave a 1 out of 5 rating. Where the trip went sideways was during our layover in DFW. We experienced a 30-minute or so delay to board the plane - no big deal, as intentionally purchased a ticket from CDG to MUN with a longer layover in case anything happened. So once all passengers were on the plane roughly 30 minutes behind schedule, we sat there for another 2-hours before actually taking off. After patiently sitting in our seats for about one hour, I knew I had to speak up about our connecting flight to make the American Airline team aware of the situation. The flight attendant assured me we would be taking off ""very shortly"" and we would ""make up time"" while in the air, so I shouldn't worry. I was reluctant to believe the flight attendant so I asked if we could exit the plane to catch another flight to Paris. She would not let us leave the plane. Rather than make a scene, which would have been no good for anyone, I chose to sit back down and wait patiently for our departure. We finally took off after sitting there for 2-hours! Of course, we did not make up any time while in the air and I'm almost certain we saw the Lufthansa connecting flight take off for Munich as we landed. Trying to keep my calm, I told the same flight attendant that we missed our connecting flight due to their delay. She said, ""you'll need to call customer service and take it up with them."" No apology, no help whatsoever with sorting it out. We got off the plane and I immediately called customer service. They shouldn't even have ""service"" in their name because they didn't do a damn thing to help, they were terribly rude. No empathy, no apology, nothing. Customer service said, ""well, you took the flight, so there is nothing we can do."" Of course, we took the flight because they wouldn't let us off the plane even after sitting there for hours! Already late to our Oktoberfest plans, I was then forced to spend another 650 EURO for two tickets from Paris to Munich.

I did not reply but I tried the toilets in the center of the aircraft (which were always busy with passengers standing on the aisle waiting) and I tried to use the toilets at the back of the aircraft but it was too much of a distance for me.  When I next approached Business Toilets the same flight attendant (who had told me to use the back toilets) approached me and said in a rude and condescending way that I should be using the toilets at the back. I told her then that I had asked the other flight attendant for permission when I first boarded and was told I could use the toilets in Business. She looked surprised. I reported this to the Department of Transportation, and to AA but the flight attendant denied telling me not to use the toilets in Business. I would like to say that when booking Premium or any upgrade one should find out where the toilets are and if one is allowed to use Business toilets when nearer to Business than the middle or back of aircraft. It is my belief that AA does not consider the toilets locations when selling seats at a higher priced upgrade.

When we got to the gate to inquire about the wheelchair, the attendants at the gate said they did not know why no one showed up with wheelchairs and had been calling down to the area where the AA wheelchairs are stationed to no avail. Some attendant who was walking around upset and furious scanned my wife's boarding pass and the other handicapped passengers, asking us to be patient and someone would be arriving shortly. Well, after we all complained again, 15 minutes later 2 people showed up but we all could tell they were not sure what they were supposed to do or where they were supposed to go (almost like they were new hires and that was their first day).

Overall, the experience left a lot to be desired. We had one layover both ways. Our first layover was in Chicago where we experienced a 4hr delay. The AA employees told the waiting passengers that two crew members were delayed and they were on their way. Every 15-30min, I would receive a text stating the flight had been delayed another 30min but very little communication from the counter and absolutely no apologies. Once aboard the plane, we were told by the pilot that due to another plane delay AA had to get new pilots and that was the reason for the delay. After sitting for several minutes, the pilot came back on to say that due to the delay, the flight pattern had been cancelled. So, there we sat in a stuffy, small airplane for another hour. Do you suppose the powers at be might have known this would happen and allow passengers to wait in the comfort of the airport at least. I am guessing they needed to get the plane off the loading gate. While sitting on the tarmac, I wrote an email to AA Customer Service in the hopes they would extend an olive branch of service recovery on our return flights (a free drink ticket, upgraded seats, maybe earlier boarding). I am in the service industry as well and know how much it means to offer a small gesture as an apology when things go wrong. No one is perfect after all. Someone did email me back, but offered vouchers for my next flight. I responded saying that I was really hoping for something on my return flight since I wasn’t sure I would be flying AA again. The staff member did respond stating that she was sorry I wasn’t happy with what was offered, but AA could not be offering anything else. So AA would rather coerce me into flying with them again with two $50 vouchers instead of providing some service recovery upfront via a couple free drinks or an upgraded boarding status which would have gone a lot further. It is no wonder this airlines falls below Southwest, Delta, JetBlue and others in customer satisfaction. I won’t fly with American again as I do not believe they truly value their customers. I will end by saying the AA counter staff at the Burlington Airport were lovely and very friendly.

I am an American Advantage Gold member who has flown to Europe multiple times using AA and its British Airways partner. In July, I purchased a Business Class ticket for 9/19 through American Express travel that was billed as British Airways #1585. I checked in at JFK 3 hours before the flight to learn that it was actually AA #236. That didn’t seem to pose any problem since my Business Class ticket was in AA’s system I was given a boarding pass for a Business Class seat 10A around 2:30 pm for my 5pm flight. Sometime during the next two hours, while I relaxed unaware in the Admirals Lounge, I was bumped out of my seat to a “Premium Economy” seat. I received no email notification nor was there any notification on the AA app. When I arrived at the gate expecting to walk into Business Class I was stopped and given an ultimatum and five minutes to decide whether to board and take the downgrade or roll the dice and fly the next day, losing a day of vacation. Of course, AA already had my luggage on the plane. The explanations I was provided for this incident were conflicting but none of them is acceptable. I was told I had purchased thru British Airways. Why should this matter? If BA premium tickets are subject to revocation then the partnership with AA is a sham. I was also told by an agent on the phone that there had been an equipment change a few months ago resulting in fewer Business Class seats available. If so, why was I issued my Business Class boarding pass at check-in, and why wasn't I notified in advance? I was also told at the gate that American had simply “oversold” Business Class and that even though I’m an Advantage Gold member I was first on the list to be downgraded. If so, that is a despicable practice. Passengers at the gate and seated around me on the plane were equally appalled. No one had ever heard of such a thing. I have been offered a voucher for future travel but I promise you it cannot begin to compensate for the ruining of the start what was supposed to be a dream vacation. I now will spend the next several weeks dreading the possibility that the same thing could happen to me on my return home from Rome. If Business Class seats mean nothing and can be downgraded what is the point of having them and what is the point of spending all that money? I was then told that I would be afforded “Business Class” treatment and amenities in my downgraded seat location but (no surprise) that was also a failure. I have been an American Advantage customer for over 30 years. This is by far the most disappointing experience I have ever had with any airline.

I would like to make mention of the incredible service the passengers in first class have been extended meanwhile the remaining passengers (I paid for priority and am seated in 8F) have to beg the rude cabin flight attendant for water. While I do not expect first class service I do expect to have some level service. The gentleman in first class has exceptional customer service and should be commended as such. I would like to call out specifically the male flight attendant offering service in the back cabin for his rude behavior. When I approached the back of the plane and asked if we could be provided service the woman flight attendant asked what I would like, I stated a glass of wine. The rude male attendant chimes in no wine ... literally that short. So then I say how about a cup of tea, as the plane is cold and we at this point have been boarded since 9:45ish and it’s clear after 10:40 pm- please note our original flight was to land on HOU at approximately 9:45 pm. He states you can have water ... so question one, why ask what I would like and then speak harshly to “the customer.” After another series of it will be another 15-20 minutes, I push the attendant button and ask (again speaking of the rude attendant) if he would ask the captain to make a special accommodation as we were to arrive in HOU at 9:45 pm for a cup of tea. He loudly states, in an inappropriate and quite honestly embarrassing manner to the cabin, she originally asked for alcohol. I do not accept being humiliated or shamed when the airline is at fault for my inconvenience. Flight number AA 2475 was to depart from gate D36 (after arriving from Curaçao (AA 2739). As I reached gate D30, I received a notification that the gate had changed to D10. We arrived at the gate and boarded the plan. Slightly after the plane is fully boarded the pilot comes on and states there are mechanical problems and that it will be about 20-30 minutes. And then states we would need to deboard. In the terminal we are told that we would have some information no later than 11 pm. I ask to be moved to the 10:05 pm flight and the gate agent tells me it would be better to stay on this flight as they were going to take the 10:05 pm plane and give it to us. This later proved to be false. I have so little confidence in the American Airlines team. We are then told to go to E9 for immediate departure (9:45 pm). It is now 11:43 pm and every 20 minutes or so we are told that we will be departing. It’s paperwork, it’s pictures. But here is the problem. I’ve asked several times for something to drink. We know it is permissible because the people in first class have had multiple rounds of cocktails. So tell me water is the only  option after several hours, is yet another lie by your very rude flight attendant. While I understand mechanical issues, the problem here is the inconsistent information, half-truths and more importantly the lack of attention given to the passengers not in first class. It wasn't until I asked for the second time that we (non-First class attendants) were even offered water after boarding, deboarding, reboarding and waiting for hours.

The bed was spacious and comfortable. The in-flight food was good with a reasonable choice. The wine list was not impressive but then neither is BA's.

One day before my flight as I was checking in, I saw the message that said that the flight was overbooked and $175 individual vouchers were offered to anyone with flexible schedules who were willing to change their flight to 2 days later. I was unable to check in online because I was traveling with a minor. The morning of my check-in, I arrived at the airport to find that the gate number on my original receipt was closed and after walking around for 20 minutes we finally arrived at the counter. When we were at the counter, I heard an airport employee say to another traveler that the American Airlines flight had been cancelled. I chose to disregard the airport employee and go to the counter because after all he was not an American Airlines employee and they should know better, right? I checked my bags in, printed my tickets and headed through security. As soon as I arrived I noticed a long line of people waiting to talk to the customer service rep at the gate to re-schedule a flight because the flight had been cancelled due to an ""operational decision"" whatever that means. I called the customer service line and they told me that I couldn't change the flight with them on the phone that I had to wait for the person at the counter. After 1 hour of waiting, I finally spoke to the person at the gate counter. He printed some ""tickets"" for me and told me that I had been re-booked to another flight the next day at 1:00 pm. I took his word for it. Later that morning I called the customer service line, because I had a feeling something wasn't right. After I talked to the person on the phone they told me that I wasn't on the 1:00 pm flight that I hadn't been re-booked. I tried to explain that person that I had tickets and an e-mail that said that I was on that flight but she kept telling me that I wasn't on their system. I got upset and asked for a supervisor, she had the same empathetic attitude as the first employee. I asked for my flight to be booked the next day and she was able to find me a flight for the same time as before. When I asked to change my returning flight to the next day in the afternoon she told me that she could price those out for me. I told her that given the circumstances and the fact that it wasn't my problem that plans have changed she should consider changing my flights at no cost. After a lot of back and forth she finally agreed to move my flight. I had to pay for seats on my returning flight because originally, my wife, my daughter and I had seats next to each other. On my departing flight we did not get seats that were next to each other because the flight was full and we had to rely on the generosity of another traveler to allow my wife to seat next to our daughter. We had to pay a very sketchy Uber driver to bring us back home that morning after losing sleep, time and going to tears from our daughter because she wasn't going to see her grandma that day. Our parents had to lose another day of work, lots of sleep and time to bring us to the airport yet again the next day. My mom in Guatemala had to make another 3 hour unnecessary trip to the Guatemalan airport because I didn't arrive on the day I was supposed to. We had to pay more to change our original car reservation because of ""high demand"" To top it all off my bag was damaged on my returning flight which to be frank I don't even understand how that happened because the bag was damaged from the zipper.

I was traveling with two fourteen-year old girls. Once our flight landed in Charlotte, they issued a two hour delay. An hour and a half into the delay, they completely cancelled our flight at 11.30 pm. I was told by the ticket agent that our particular flight was cancelled due to a maintenance issue. Their only offer of a solution was to get us on another flight two days later, which would entail a seven hour trip (flying up to Washington DC, then back south to Myrtle Beach). We would not arrive at Myrtle until 7.00 pm two days later. Our family drove there and were waiting for our arrival. We would have missed out on two of our five days there. I told the agent this was not an acceptable option. So, at midnight we were rushing through an unfamiliar airport trying desperately to get to a rental car agency to secure a car rental. After being up 18 hours at that point, we rented a car from Hertz for a 24 hour period $292.66. I drove four hours and arrived at Myrtle at 4.00 am. It was not a pleasant experience. I called the AA customer service by 10.00 am and was told to submit all of the receipts for the costs I incurred because AA cancelled our flight. I was assured I would be reimbursed for the rental car because the flight was cancelled due to maintenance issues, not related to weather. I filed my request to AA on July 9th. I submitted all receipts on July 16th. I wrote to them again on July 31st because I had received no response. On August 1st I received a generic letter stating they would refund each of us $87.02 for the portion of the flight that was cancelled. They gave each of us $150 flight vouchers, which I will not use. I wrote back on August 1st and 2nd stating I needed my refund for the rental car and that the vouchers were useless to us. They wrote back on the 2nd stating they will not refund me and continuously ended each letter with ""we're eager to serve you again"". I filed a complaint with the DOT and a month later received another generic letter stating that they gave me a refund for the cancelled flight portion and a voucher. They refuse to reimburse me for the rental car. They stated they offered another flight (this was available two days later). They actually expected a woman and two 14-year old girls to accept a flight two days later and to just hang out at the airport? I will never attempt to fly with American Airlines. There is no phone number for a supervisor. I was told ""we do not escalate our customer complaints to a supervisor"". They did not treat us as paying customers, only as numbers.

Every time I fly American there is so type of problem due to incompetent employees who don’t know what they are doing. We have flown American about 4 times and the first time we flew them we signed up for their Aadvantage card thinking it would be worth getting the miles. On our most recent trip our flight on Tuesday Sep. 3 was canceled due to the hurricane back home in Florida. They let us pick which flight back and only had one Thursday with a layover. My boyfriends sister was flying back to Miami the same day which did not get canceled. That night we called American to get on that flight back so we could just drive home and not be stuck in LA for three extra days. The lady on the phone told my boyfriend that we can’t change our flight to land into another city because we bought our tickets using the points from our AAdvantage card?  What ever, that night we booked two extra nights on a hotel that was over 100$ a night because we were going to be stuck here. The next morning I got a notification letting me know there are two extra flights available to take Tuesday morning that would land us in Melbourne Florida and not Orlando which didn’t make any sense considering the worker said there are no flights for us besides Orlando. We call in the morning again to see about getting on the flight to Miami yet again and the lady on that phone said we could do it. So she put us on that flight so we could get home that day. We did not have enough clothes or even money to be able to spend two and a half extra days in LA between the hotel, rental car, gas etc. Of course the hotel was non refundable and we had to argue with them to get our money back. BUT all of this could have been avoided if the employees knew what they were doing. So we get to the airport Tuesday morning to head on the Miami flight which the app told us that we had to go to a counter to check in. So of course the workers holding the line up asks us what we are doing which we show them the phone and they go “well did you try the kiosk” I said “no because it says right here we have to check in with a person and not online. So of course he said to go wait in that line to see -  after 10 minutes of waiting I get to the kiosk to just get told by the machine to check in with the counter. So we go to the counter desk and a huge line that we waiting in for 40 minutes .. after getting to someone they clearly didn’t know what they were doing because two employees just shoved us off to the next employee .. some guy in the Miami airport counter just clocked in and two employees just told him to figure it out. They were telling us that the lady we spoke to on the phone this morning did not change our ticket in the system yet we had a confirmation with seat numbers to our email.

The ticket agent said we had time to run to the bathroom, but when we returned, that same ticket agent watched us approach, rushed to shut the door to the ramp and almost gleefully told us “sorry, you can’t board.” We inquired as to what to do next, and she said we could go stand-by. After waiting through 3 over-sold flights, we realized that there was no way we would board a flight to Miami going stand-by. We called American and the agent offered us two new flights at almost $400 a piece without any credit for the more than $300 we’d already paid for the original flight. I called United and a great guy got us on another flight the following morning for only $140 total for the two of us. While in Miami, my daughter became very ill and was hospitalized for 4 days. The doctor would not release her from his care in time for our flight. I called American and explained the situation. They offered to “help” us, but they would have to charge a “change’ fee to the tune of $480! After many failed conversations with American Airlines, I gave up. I felt like we were being extorted. We were stranded and nearly broke through no fault of our own and they would not budge an inch to give us a reasonable flight. I called Southwest airlines. They gave us a flight home for little more than $168 a piece, which was much less than American’s “change” fee.

The last one read, “We’re very sorry for the situation. We feel it was outside the norm and for that reason we hope you’ll allow us another chance in the future.” Still no offer of compensation for the more than $700 they pocketed from us.

I usually fly out of a small town airport, so it doesn't take me long to get through TSA and boarded... So I got a lovely surprise when I couldn't get on the plane. Apparently, I was just cut off by a couple of minutes. And instead of helping me reschedule my flight (even to another day), the lady had to put me on standby (another company policy for 'missed flights') - so I wasn't even ever guaranteed any flight and had to sit in the airport for hours waiting, continually going back to the desk to get a new standby ticket for a new flight. This policy is not okay. Plane tickets are expensive and people's time is priceless. In addition, when all the hullababo was over, I still could have gotten through TSA in time to get on the flight. That was the most heartbreaking part. In addition, the woman next to me was also late, and the clerk at the desk was absolutely rude to her. He spoke in a very condescending tone of voice. He said things like: ""you missed the same flight yesterday,"" ""I guess it just wasn't meant to be then,"" and ""you need to understand that you should be at the airport ready for your flight two hours before!"" (Note: usually I agree with this advise-- but not in a rude way like the clerk said it or for a very small airport like Bangor!). I get it, it's not an easy job and people are annoying-- I have worked in service, too! But if you can't handle people without being mean, find another job! It was super uncomfortable being next to her and having to listen to his rudeness - imagine how she feels! Rude service, bad policy, and a generally uncomfortable flying experience. It's with the extra money for Delta. Treat yourself and avoid the hastle!",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangor to Philadelphia via Los Angeles,August 2019,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,,1,Recommendedno

I arrived at LaGuardia in NY at 7 am and had a connector flight to Richmond, VA. 30 minutes before boarding they came over intercom and said that the flight was completely cancelled, not delayed but completely cancelled. The reason, because the had to much air traffic i.e. they overbooked. They put me on next flight, at 9 pm. I asked for other options and they give no one options. They were very unprofessional throughout the whole process, laughing and joking with each other. When asked for a meal ticket they were reluctant to even give me that even though it was there fault that they were over booked. This happens apparently 4 times a week on this connection alone and yet American continues to screw people over with no remorse. One of the customers had to get his 10 year old son to doctor in Richmond and they still didnt make accommodations for him. Now it is 9 pm and we were supposed to board at 8:45 pm but low and behold it is late and wont be here until 9:36 pm. This airline is pure trash and I dont recommend.

I contacted the customer relation and been emailing back and forth with them regarding the situation that my family and I had came across on July 30,2019. All we get back in response was an apologize and a reply kept saying thank you for our feedback and they will use this feedback to improve. I am very disappointed with AA. When we arrived at ICN airport from Vietnam, we were greeted by ICN staff at our gate as we landed. The staff helped all the passenger that is flying to Dallas on the flight AA0280 to get to the gate as soon as possible so we wouldn’t be late for our departure. There was 29-39 of us running across every terminals along with the staff trying to rush. The staff even called AA staff from the gate to let them know we’re on the way. As we arrived at the gate with AA0280, there was about 25 more minutes to departure but AA refused to let anyone from our flight onto AA. Their reasoning was unacceptable! They said we’re late and we have no document from our previous flight stating why we were late. There was other individuals passenger from a different flight was still able to get on board with AA. They allowed those individuals but not anyone from flight KE0686. We were not late for our flight with AA and their gate was still open. We were treated unfairly and their reasoning was unacceptable. My family and I brought our tickets with AA with a reserved seats. They had no reason to refuse to let us on unless they gave up our seating without our permission. AA is known for overbooking passengers on their flight.  The flight we brought is from Korean to Dallas but they exchanged our ticket from Korea to San Francisco to Dallas. We had to recheck all our luggage again at San Francisco. All the trouble they put us through was not right. We did not brought our ticket to go through all this trouble. We were suppose to work that morning that we arrived on 7/31/19 but because we were so overwhelmed and exhausted from all the trouble that AA put us through we were not able to make it to work. AA is not taking responsible for their wrong. They said our flight was late, which it was not late for AA. If we were late, why are other passengers able to get on 10 minutes after us? Something doesn’t sound right. “Under the federal rules, passenger is entitled to cash compensation, not just a voucher, and a seat for a later on flight. According to U.S, we have laws that they are forced to pay those.”  I tried to explained to AA but they refused to take action for their wrongs. I even attached a video clip of almost all the people that kept behind that was on the same flight as my family and I. On behalf of my family and I and also 29-39 other passengers, AA need to be responsible for this. This is their fault for either overbooking or giving up our seats.

Mexico City to Los Angeles. American Airlines has charged my credit card twice for services that I never received. In early 2018, I was charged $96.12 to upgrade my mother’s seat on a flight. However, on that flight, AA did not upgrade her seat.  Recently in July 2019, the same thing happened. I tried to upgrade my mother’s and my seat on an international trip, a birthday gift to my dear mother. For some reason, they upgraded mine but not my mother’s. It was a huge inconvenience for my 89 year old mother and me to seat separately for the 5 hour flight (on the upside, they let my mother have the upgrade while I sat in economy). A couple weeks later, I happened to check my credit card account and saw that AA had assessed two charges of $200.20 each, even though they only upgraded my ticket and not my mother’s.  When I mentioned my fear of being overcharged based on my previous experience, the airport representative who helped check us in assured me that I would not be charged for the upgrade that was not allowed. Also, I was only given a receipt for one upgrade of $200.20. On both occasions, I only discovered the inappropriate charges weeks later while checking my credit card statements (which I honestly don’t do often but must try to from now on). If I had not discovered the charges, AA would probably not have reimbursed me! Second, AA did not have the courtesy to issue any apology whatsoever on either occasion for the overcharge!

My father started insisting that they have to confirm our seats because we did not want to go through the stress of being standby again. Again, the customer service was absolutely horrible and a supervisor had to come in to make sure we got what we wanted. We left LGA that night at 10:30 PM.

Our next flight was around 9 AM so we got to the airport around 6 AM. Nothing significant happened until it was time to start boarding.

I won't be booking with American again because of disrespectful customer service manager who lied to me several times, was sarcastically belittling my grievance, and offered no solution. I booked my family's vacation to this year on American because I wanted the assurance of picking a seat when my two daughters flew for the very first time. Specifically I passed up the cheaper tickets from several other airlines so that I could pick window seats for my daughters and my family could sit together with assigned seats. I booked 8 months ahead of the trip and paid for the specific fair where we could choose seats. A week before the first flight, I checked the app and to my surprise my family had been moved from 2 window seats for the girls and the 2 middle seats to 4 internal seats in the middle of the plane with no notification on both of our flights. I called to inquire and the initial agent reviewed the trip, acknowledged that no notification had been made, and that the original seats were now an additional $244 - but now came with free drinks for my 4 and 7 year old. The original agent was empathetic, admitted that there were plenty of open window seats, but offered no alternatives (aside from the up-charge) so I requested a manager. The manager offered no empathy (let alone an apology) and sarcastically suggested that the airline moved us because they ""had it in for E & F seat passengers"" - not humorous given the situation, and then he then repeated lied about the process, available seats, and lack of communication about the change. He even went to his go-to excuse that the original flight was on a 737MAX that was grounded but, the original email clearly shows that the original flights were on an Airbus A321 and he couldn't even admit that he had made that up. Last month when American stranded me cross-country on a business trip and their solution was a flight home two days later, I spoke to empathetic agents that did their best. I had no complaints despite the fact that it cost me time and money where the solution involved me flying back to an airport several hours away from my destination to rent a car to finish the journey.

What I didn't expect was a rude desk attendant at the gate and at customer service in a Philadelphia airport surrounded by a beautiful sunset - no apparent weather issues in sight. I spent over $250 on a one way car rental (and an hour trying to find a one way car rental) and drove the 5 hours to arrive in Syracuse at 2:30am. American Airlines booked me on the first flight to Syracuse Saturday the 20th at 3:20pm. Fast Forward to today, July 22nd and I am scheduled to leave Syracuse at 6:57pm, delay till 7:20 ... 7:31 take off. Preparing to run to my connecting gate but - no need - when we hit the ground I get notified my flight is delayed until 11:06pm. And then cancelled. I immediately call and am offered the first flight to Tampa 10:30 something am - nope wait can't have that one, its booked. The next I have available is 4:06pm! I asked if there was an any other flight to any Florida airport in the morning - no. Great, I am booked and get to spend the next 18 hours in an airport. I get on American's Website and find a 6am flight to Orlando and purchase - then call to have the associate fix this mess and she scolds me for booking the flight - saying I should have just called them for help. Wait - while I am going thru this mess my Mother is stuck overnight in O'Hare with a similar American Airlines epic-mess and has to go through the same thing. American will not reimburse the car I rented, they will not pay for me to have a hotel room tonight - there are ""snacks and cots"" available in the airport. Gone are the days of vouchers, this is all ""God's will"" and ""weather related"". Going forward I will pay twice as much for a plane ticket from another airline, I will never fly American Airlines again, if it is the only flight available I would rather rely on my good old fashioned feet to get me there faster then an American Airlines Plane.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Syracuse via Philadelphia,July 2019,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,Recommendedno

","""the crew was timed out""",Kimberly French,United States,23rd July 2019,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  This has been my first ever experience with American Airlines and it was not a good one. My first leg of travel from Erie, PA (ERI) to Tampa, FL (TPA) via Charlotte, NC (CLT) was uneventful and smooth. I arrived on time with my baggage and was quite happy with the service of the agents, flight attendants and crew. My journey home was another matter. First let me begin by saying that I understand that the airline industry cannot control the weather. Mother Nature decided to throw a fit and cover TPA in thunderstorms and lightning for several hours causing the airport to close which resulted in my missing the connection in CLT to ERI. No worries. I contacted the gate agent who quickly re-booked me onto the first flight out from CLT to ERI the next morning at 11:30am. As I had arranged hotel accommodations in Charlotte, I inquired as to how I could retrieve my bags upon arrival in CLT. She told me to simply contact the gate agent upon arrival and my bags would be retrieved for me to take to the hotel. This is NOT what happened! Upon arriving at CLT, I did contact the gate agent about my bags and was instructed to go to the baggage claim area and speak to the agent in the baggage office. I did so. There were a few people in line ahead of me inquiring about the location of their missing bags and I could quickly see how one agent was doing everything in her power to locate them, while my agent seemed to feel that the passengers (including myself) were simply a nuisance to her existence. Without effort in actually locating my bags, she informed me that she had no idea where my bags might be and did little to attempt to locate them. A baggage handler in the office was looking over her shoulder at the computer screen, asked me if my flight had landed yet! then shrugged his shoulders like, “Oh well” When I told her that I had hotel accommodations and simply needed my bags retrieved from the plane I just de-boarded so that I had clean clothing and toiletries, she handed me a complimentary American Airlines toiletry bag (which is its own review). The following morning, I arrived at the airport at 9am, passed through TSA screening and arrived at my gate with time to spare. Our plane was boarded and all passengers and crew quickly assessed that the air conditioning wasn’t quite up to par. We were de-planed and told that the air conditioning would be fixed, or another plane would be provided. Our flight was now delayed. Approximately 2 hours later, we were again seated on the plane only to be told that, again, the air conditioning was not functioning correctly and the crew was “timed out”. Our flight was now cancelled. There was one more flight to ERI from CLT that day, but it was full. I was able to arrange for a seat on the next flight to Cleveland. This meant that I had to impose upon a relative to drive 2 hours to Cleveland and another 2 hours home. Upon arrival at the terminal for the flight to Cleveland, I quickly noticed the difference in accommodations for passenger travelling to Cleveland versus those for passengers travelling to Erie. The seats in the waiting area were more comfortable and were equipped with charging stations for personal electronics, while Erie passengers were seated in worn, cramped, and uncomfortable seats with smaller charging stations (with access for 6 devices) in the waiting area.

Once we arrived to Kona, we discovered that all of our new luggage was damaged (deep scrapes and scratches, and a thick black tar substance that would not wipe off).

He asked that I reply to his email with photos for a second time. He stated that he would review the information and contact me with a resolution, of which he never did. I called to follow up with him, and was told that he was on another call and he'd call me right back. As of the writing of this review, he still has not followed up with me.

Meanwhile I have not any updates from AA trough text, Although we signed up for it. The nightmare got worse when a dozen passengers or so going to Atlanta were prevented from boarding the shuttle (a 2 minute bus ride) to the next concourse, where our flight was still waiting, due to adverse weather conditions. We were directed to customer service desk. What occurred there is a classic example of how AA employees treat customers with disdain and condescension. I was informed that I would be put on a flight for the next morning although my flight still on the ground. When I asked her if she could find alternate route for me to get home the same night, she sighed, rolled her eyes, and told me step aside since I didn't want to be helped.

Unfortunately AA is not the caliber of airline it probably was in years past. I typically fly Delta with great success however on certain flights I’ve used US Air (now AA) but this last experience was such a cluster that I felt it warranted a review. On our outbound flight from DFW to Colorado Springs our flight was continually delayed as well as with each delay the gates seemed to move as well - at one point it got so ridiculous it became comical. Our departure out of DFW had officially past our originally arrival time in COS. Regardless we rolled with it because hey we’re on vacay and not worth letting it impact our mood. (Keep in mind this delay was not impacted by weather - not sure what the issue was here and they didn’t seem to want to explain) On our return flight out of COS to DFW the flight was cancelled around 3pm for a 4:38 departure. But it gets better from here. We just happened to be first in line to check our bag when the cancellation announcement was made...we thought ok at least were in line already. We step up to the counter and tell the young lady we realize she’s not responsible and we appreciate anything she can do to help us. First offer was best they could do was get us out on. Monday flight (it was Saturday) bc all their flights on Sunday we’re booked. After several concerning questions I got her to agree to explore putting us on another carrier - our options United or Delta. We asked for Delta based on their hub locations and our final destination. Then we were told nothing available. We thought we had seats on a United flight out the next day but still exploring same day departure options we stopped at the Delta counter to see what flights they had - they had options out that evening as well as next day. We went back to American counter spoke to supervisor (with flight info from the Delta rep) and he said he could get us on that flight - he assured us all was good and cancelled our “seat” on United. This is where it got ridiculous - we took our voucher to Delta only to find AA rep never fully finished the booking and we in fact weren’t confirmed and now the seats in United were gone as well. We went back and forth between counters - each only to find the AA reps were not completing the process to truly get their client booked on another carrier and the other carrier flights were now selling out. One AA passenger ended up going to Delta and paying a higher rate to hurry and guarantee her a seat in hopes AA would make it right. This went on and on and on with multiple passengers. Hours later now all flights out of COS Saturday and Sunday were gone and we were then told our only option was to shuttle from COS to Denver at $50 per person, rent a hotel room and get to airport Sunday morning (unconfirmed seats on Delta) and pray we make it home. Thankfully the ticket and gate agents with Delta were empathetic and worked hard to make sure they got us on. I was told at the airport they couldn’t compensate us for any of our out of picket expenses we wouldn’t have to call AA - which I did only for the guy on the other end to be completely rude and inform me I should had taken that up with the folks at the airport and if they told me to call them they then lied.

I saw a customer get yelled at and was asked to return when he was “ready to listen”, and then the American Airlines employee stormed off. They are extremely rude, they could care less about their customers, and they do the very bare minimum.

Never have I been treated this badly before. It was just terrible customer service from the beginning to the end. I had three flights with AA. The first one from Grand Rapids to Chicago was delayed due to weather issues therefore I just made it to my second one which was also 30 min delayed. While I was trying to get the second plane AA rebooked me without my knowledge to a different flight ( Grand Rapids - Charlotte - Frankfurt). Had I not checked my emails would I not have known that they have done that. First off: as I had already left Grand Rapids and landed in Chicago this connection did not make any sense nor was it possible for me to take these flights. Second: they did not want to let me on my plane to London, which was the flight I had booked. It seemed that they did overbook the flight and therefore had problems getting everybody on the plane. Others who were rebooked on the flight I had booked originally were allowed to go whereas I was not. The crew was very rude to me and would just ignore me. They were unfriendly and just told me it was not their fault. They did not care about my case nor did they want to help. I had to beg them to help me. They ended up allowing me to go on the plane to London. They did not assure me a seat on my third flight the plane to Frankfurt although I had already checked in to this flight. In addition to that since I did make it on the plane to London I would have definitely made it to my last flight too. I also had a valid boarding pass for this flight. When I said I needed to get to Frankfurt they just said it was not their problem and they would get me to London but not any further. To “comfort” me (and I do not want to say this word as they did not show any emotion nor empathy towards me or any of the passengers) they said London was closer to Frankfurt than Chicago. While this might be true this is a sign of a big lack of customer service. Employees at AA do not seem to have been given ANY training on how to behave towards customers. I ended up crying because I just got so upset and they did tell me I might as well stay in Chicago and fly out tomorrow. Well thank you for being so compassionate. Never again will I fly with American Airlines again. To me it seems that they cannot handle the simplest problems or even normal situations related to flight delays and connections.

I forward the complaint to Customer service; I ask them to compensate me for my hotel room ($129) and I may travel with American again. They tell me no. I explained that I travel every month for my job and they won't invest $129 to keep a customer. Obviously the return of investment is there for American airlines, but they couldn't see it.

(I will not even bother reviewing this, because AA has evidently given up on their domestic product - no drinks served, no food choice, rude service - .no point in a review as I mentioned). 787 is a great aircraft and after the take off came a quick meal service. When I say quick, I mean about 60 mins into the flight all of the meal service was served and the purser and flight attendants happily seated and chatting in front cabin. I have gone to the bathroom in front by the pilot's door at one point, only to be rudely ""thrown out"" by a blond flight attendent telling me the curtain was closed and to use other bathrooms. I quickly realized the reason for this. They were eating, drinking, playing their iPad games and I saw it all. I am not an arguing type, so I simply left, only to be called back by a somewhat nicer flight attendant, who ended up having an argument with the other over which bathroom I could use. Mortified, I proceeded to the bathroom, only to leave it few moments later with a deadly look by the blond flight attendant, who then went onto serving me my pre-arrival snack, by slamming it onto my table and giving me the evil eye. Oh American...it is HUGE understatment to say that as an Executive Platinum, who used to like the new AA is overall discouraged. I fly every month for business. Mainly LAX-LHR or SYD, I have seen the service to go steeply downhill in the past year and half, but nothing prepared me for this. Should I mention the horrible defrosted cold lamb offered submerged in what seemed like pieces of ice mixed with water and what remotely resembled potato puree? Or should I mention the red wine, which evidently could not beat $3 bottle of Chuck Shaw at Trader Joes? Amazingly upset stomach, horrible headache and 10 hours later, I finally reached my point of taking my business elsewhere. I also heard, AA is changing their frequent flyer award redemption, following DL nad UA (how about being a leader AA and being loyal to your customer base and keeping the current FF system, afterall you slashed 80% of the value only 2 years ago, do you need to screw us even further with your 5 billion dollar net profit?) to ""dynamic"" awards. I have left DL and UA for this very reason, and avoid flying them. I guess now it will be AA, unless they make radical changes to their service and treatment of the loyal frequent fliers.

After the boarding procedure was complete, the captain announced the right front tire needed to be replaced and we needed to deplane again.

It was originally scheduled for 6:30pm. The ground staff at the gate said she would inform me if my checked baggage made it onto this flight after everyone had boarded, but she NEVER got back to me. Very irresponsible. When I got to LGA, the ground staff first told me my bag was on the plane, but later on said it was still on AA 1834 to Newark as my bag never appeared on the baggage belt. They informed me that the baggage could be delivered throughout the night, so I provided them with my hotel address. After AA 1834 landed, I called the AA baggage hotline and they told me the complete opposite. They said the baggage will have to be delivered the next day. I have had enough of this nonsense and I needed my suitcase the next day for an important meeting, so I took an UBER to pick up the baggage myself. When I picked up my baggage, the zipper was open and taped together loosely with AA tape.

When your flight matters, when you have a vacation on the line or a critical meeting, and something goes wrong - don't expect AA to lift a finger to make it right. The policy they have shared with me is ""If we make an exception for you, we have to make an exception for everyone"" - Well that's the point! You should be making things right for every passenger you screwed over on this flight. My flight was AA515 Cancun to Phoenix, final destination Orange County CA. That's ONE connecting flight. Our flight was turned around mid-flight - the captain came on and explained we had mechanical issues. This is terrifying to hear. There was no mention of ""this is a minor issue and we are not going to crash and die"". People were panicking, praying, crying with stress and panic. We were told we would not receive an alternate flight that day and we would be sent to a hotel and be given dinner and breakfast. Bottom line, the transportation from/to the airport, the hotel, and the food was all unacceptable. We were herded around like cattle with no explanation of what was going on. When we were bussed back to the airport we encountered AA employees who had no idea what our situation was, and when we explained things they didn't care at all. ""Next!"" So instead of getting another flight set up to handle a full flight of people whose flight was cancelled, they just tried to put everyone wherever they could to fly out of Cancun. We ended up forced into a flight plan that didn't even get us home until the next day! After already missing a day of work over this, and begging our dog sitter to stay another day, we HAD to get home Friday. Their suggested route was Miami/Orlando/Phoenix/Orange County (Saturday). At the ticket counter in Miami, we spoke with the dumbest customer service employee I've ever spoken to, who spoke to himself instead of speaking to us, and he couldn't produce any flight solution that got us within 50 miles of home (that's 4 airports) on Friday. After we worked on our phones for a few minutes we found a flight that he missed and were able to convince him to get us on it. That's literally the rebooking agent's job - and he couldn't do it. Fast forward to Phoenix customer service desk and we realized the whole trip we hadn't sat next to each other - we went to the clerk and asked her if she could help us, after the day we have had, and waive a seat change fee (~$12). NO, she said plainly. This small gesture of courtesy was not even considered. This would have gone a long way in simply showing they care. But they 100% do not care about any of us. When we finally arrive in OC, surprise, or baggage was lost. Speaking to customer support we were told AA was not responsible for any of our $200+ in incidental unexpected charges (receipts provided) for the extra day of travel. They still wouldn't budge on the seat change fees, and now a random unexplained $12.87 charge is on my card that they won't address. They force you into an email only conversations - they claim their structure prevents the need for a supervisor to be involved. That their email team is the highest escalation possible. Speaking to someone in person is not allowed. You will take what they give you and you will like it!

I have been a very long American Airlines (AA) flyer (since 1993), an American AAdvantage member since 2001, and an AAdvantage credit card holder since 2011. I just went through the worst flying experience I’ve ever had and as a result I’m going to try as hard as I can to avoid AA in the future. This all started with a canceled flight (AA1373) due to weather that actually didn’t impact the flight path at the time. I understand safety concerns, but canceling a flight that’s part of a larger booking literally hours before without a better solution than moving to next day is just not acceptable, and having some of the most incompetent customer support didn’t help our overall situation either. It was a flight from Austin to Dallas as part of another booking to Europe. The reason I know the weather didn’t impact the flight is because I wound up getting a rental car last minute instead and drove the 3 hours to Dallas to make the connecting flight. The communication of the canceled flight was literally hours before the takeoff. My wife and I were lucky enough to find a rental car in time, and after 2-3 hours on the phone making sure we could fly from Dallas (our connecting airport), AA decided to cancel and rebook the flight for the next day mid-drive! Thankfully we were able to get the issue resolved during our drive and at the airport. So, $140 later for the rental car, around 3-4 hours on the phone, and a 3 hour drive later, we made our connecting flight (operated by British Airways). We thought we were done with the horror of this, but on the return flight AA incompetence struck again. We had to wait at the customer assistance desk for BA (who were very helpful) while their ticketing support was on the line with AA for over 45 minutes. AA noted that I had already flown the flight we were at the airport checking-in to. Apparently I am now a time-traveler. We were at the airport over two hours before our flight. However, we didn’t get checked in until 15 minutes before boarding at LHR which is one of the largest airports. We managed to drop off our luggage under 5 minutes before cut-off time, and we made barely made it to our gate despite going through security after our boarding already started. This was all due to our persistence and BA customer service help. The entire trip was stressful, hectic, and AA left us with a horrible taste for their service. We received no refunds for the cancelled flight, no upgrades for having to rent a car and drive instead of flying our initial leg of the journey, nothing for having to be on the phone literally for hours trying to make sure we can fly and fixing the rebooked cancellation, nothing for messing up our bookings while on the phone trying to fix their mistake, nothing for stressing and spending a lot of time at service desks at airports, nothing for running through airports instead of spending quality time and enjoying our trip, no apology, nothing at all. The only silver lining is that we actually made it to where we should eventually and with our luggage, but that was only due to our persistence and BA customer service and help. Since all the years of flying with AA I have seen service degrade while other airlines have only improved theirs. I feel really bad for countless other people who didn’t have the know-how and persistence that we did to fix AA’ mistakes. I hope this review at least shines some light on the incompetence, and hopefully helps others in to make a decision when flying.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to London via Dallas Ft Worth,May 2019,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,,2,Recommendedno

We were scheduled to leave on Monday 05/27 after 11:00 AM - the flight got delayed so many times I quit counting. We did get on the plane in the afternoon and sat on the tarmac for 2 hours (the 1st hour was spent without air conditioning or water) only to have to return to the gate (the excuse was related to weather but we are thinking it had something to do with the flight crew exceeding their time limits). The flight finally got canceled after we spent the entire day at RAP. The funny thing was there was no communication from the American gate during this time while the other airlines were constantly keeping their customers up-to-date via the airport's intercom (this is a regional airport so you could hear all the gate communications). We ended up spending the night at the airport since the flight was rescheduled for early the next morning (no vouchers for hotels offered of course!). When we called American customer service early the next day, there was no confirmation that Flight 3098 was scheduled to leave at 7:00 AM on 05/28 so we decided to get rebooked thru DFW.

We got a call on the intercom to come to the gate. The gate attendant basically moved us back to the ORD flight without our agreement (we had assigned seats BTW), lied about the weather at ORD and refused to honor the $600 voucher.

Stranded in STT airport for 48 hours by American Airlines due to hydraulic leak, and passengers left to their own devices to find a way home. Detailed version: AA flight 1195 on 5/22/19 had a mechanical problem we were told should take an hour to fix. After a couple of hours, we were told to board the plane. The pilot said there was a hydraulic leak, and a patch had been made. I could see the copilot standing in front of the wing watching as the pilot tested out the patch while we were all seated on the plane. Suddenly, the copilot made a frantic gesture moving his hands across his throat (""cut it"" signal) to tell the pilot to stop testing. The pilot said the patch had blown, and hydraulic fluid was all over the ground. It seems unsafe that passengers were on board the plane while this hydraulic patch was being tested. The AA staff held us at the airport until 9pm when they finally started distributing vouchers to a musty, dirty hotel. We finished eating our voucher dinner at 11pm. Before leaving the airport, AA staff told us to come back for an 8am flight the next day, 5/23. At dinner we were told our flight had been delayed until 2pm on 5/23. Before we checked out of the hotel, we found out the flight was delayed again until 6pm. I immediately called the AA booking hotline to get another flight. I spoke over an hour with a manager who said there were no seats on any flights from STT that day, even on other airlines. So we were stuck waiting to see if our AA plane had actually been fixed. On 5/23, we sat in the airport all day, watching other AA passengers arrive on a different working plane and fly off to Charlotte, which was our destination. They would not allow us to board the working plane, though we had been waiting 24 hours. We were stranded since we were ""assigned to"" the broken plane. The gate agents told us they had no info about when the plane would be fixed. They were waiting for information ""from above"". Many people asked to speak with the AA manager for STT airport. The AA clerks radioed him over and over, but he stayed outside on the tarmac so that no one could speak to him. Some people had run out of medication, and others with special diets like myself (Celiac disease) were feeling faint from a lack of gluten free food. At 7pm they began handing out hotel vouchers again, and released us from the airport with no information about when our flight was rescheduled. We spent another night in the hotel. We called the AA booking phone number for 3 hours talking to various agents, who said they could not transfer us to a Delta flight that showed seats available online since it was overbooked. Finally, we were passed to a manager who said he found two ""reserved operations"" seats on an AA flight to Philadelphia used for situations like this. I asked why I wasn't offered these seats earlier that morning when I was on the phone with a booking manager since it could have saved me 24 hours of delay! We went to the airport for a 3rd day in a row on 5/24. We finally made it home at midnight on 5/24/19, which is 48 hours after our original scheduled arrival time. Due to the 48 hour delay, our pets were held at the kennel 2 days past when we were supposed to pick them up. We incurred extra fees for the kennel, as well as airport parking, and my husband wasted 2 extra ""vacation"" days spent all day in an airport.

I arrived on time to [email protected] 9:30. Once we arrived there was a plain stationed in our bay so we were told it would be a delay. The American Airline passengers did not bother to contact the connecting flight to Yuma and tell them we were in phoenix. So once we got off of the flight and were going to B5 to catch the connecting flight it was closed and we were advised to go to customer service. Once we got to customer service the line was so long, it took an hour to get to the counter only to be told that the customer service closed at 11:00 and we needed to go to another customer service Kiosk on the other side of the airport. by this time, I was tired, had been up since 5:00 in the morning east coast time. I called customer service and was asked if I wanted to be reimbursed. I explained to the agent that this wasn't a pleasure trip, I had flown here for a funeral. she then said, well I can send you back to Charlotte and give you a full refund. I just hung up. Once it was my turn in the customer service line. I was told that i had to spend the night at the airport and the next flight was full so I would have to take the next flight at 10:52. I then became loud and explained to her that thus was of no fault of mine and I should not have to be inconvenienced because of a mistake made by the airline. She then offered me a night at the double tree hotel and a food voucher for a 12.00 meal. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in the customer service received on this trip and not only that the huge inconvenience it caused. I plan to contact US airways next week and if they are not willing to offer me a refund. I will never use them again.

I just want to say that American Airlines on two separate occasions has earned back my loyalty. The first time was on a trip from Chicago to the Dominican Republic. My husband had his wallet in a backpack stowed under the seat in front of him. During the trip, it must have popped out. We exited the plane, made it through customs with his passport that was in his pocket and only realized upon exiting the airport and meeting our driver that his wallet was missing. We had no idea if it was stolen, lost, where it was, etc. The driver immediately encouraged us to go back to the American Airlines office in the airport which was quite a feat given the language barrier. By the time my husband got upstairs to AA, his wallet had already been turned in and was waiting for him there with nothing missing. You can imagine the heart-pounding anxiety of losing your wallet, which basically contains your life, in a foreign country. A real vacation killer. So thank you for whoever was involved in returning the wallet. You have no idea how grateful I am. Second, my daughter, a med student in the Chicago area, recently flew to Cameroon, Africa on a trip to bring medical supplies to a surgeon and work with him in the small towns and villages. As part of the trip, she was bringing a large duffle bag filled with prescription meds, surgical gear, etc. at her own expense. The baggage person at American at O'Hare grew very quiet and had to enter every item in the bag onto a form. She was very concerned about not being allowed to bring the items, as this was a requirement of the trip. She was amazed and surprised when the $360 baggage fee was waived by American Airlines because they had a heart and recognized the humanitarian mission in the trip.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Punta Cana,February 2019,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,Recommendedyes

In Barcelona, we were asked to check our Carry On baggage due to the expectation that the overhead storage was already full.

The pilot gave everyone the opportunity to step off the plane until the problem was resolved my maintenance. One of the AA gate attendance began arguing with customers for leaving the plane even though we explained to him that this was something approved by the captain. We arrived in Washington, DC to be told that our carry on bags did not arrive with our plane. Even after over an hour delay, the bags didn’t get placed on the plane. This is unacceptable.

I am currently on hold right now with American Airlines after waiting over an hour to speak with a representative to find out the status of my 2nd bag.

They told me, no problem, I should be able to fly standby on the 6:30 am flight in Yuma so I could make my connection. They said it would cost an extra $75. Not so bad. Three days later I arrived before the Yuma AA agent and asked to fly standby on the 6:30 am flight. The agent and supervisor said, ""No"" I did not purchase an upgraded ticket and ""No"", I could not fly standby, I would have to purchase another ticket for $230. They were flat out unconcerned, bordering on rude, and unwilling to find a solution for me. I was absolutely stuck and had to purchase the ticket. The worst part of this is that everyone I spoke to from the security guards to desk agents, said of the airport confusion, ""This always happens,"" and from a relative of an American Airlines family member, ""American Airlines is in trouble for the terrible customer service.""

If there’s an award for least child friendly airline, American Airlines wins by a landslide. Their website claims they have bassinets on long haul flights which are first come first serve at the gate. Correction; only if you want to pay an extra $120 for it or pay even more to upgrade your seats. When I asked if the bassinet was available, the answer was “oh, people are already sitting in those seats and they aren’t going to want to ask them to move”. Great customer service. I was then lied to at the gate and told the bassinet was already claimed, but when I looked on the kiosk at the gate, those seats were available for a paid upgrade. Really helpful for me on an overnight 8 hour flight with an 8 month old baby. The icing on the cake is that they don’t even have priority boarding for families with small children. Holding my crying infant, they told me I had to “wait for my boarding group”. By the time we got to our seats, the overhead compartment was full above us, where we needed to access bottles, formula, and toys. I can deal with my crying child because your agents clearly have no empathy for an exhausted mother and baby, but who really paid the price is the rest of your passengers who got to listen to it all night. Nice to know you care more about the money for the upgrade of the bassinet over every passenger in economy class. I didn’t choose  to fly your airline, I had to because of sick in-laws and getting to Rio in time. Emirates Airline offers 2  bassinets in every section of 777 economy class, 6 in total, for no extra cost.

American Airlines is the single worst airline I have ever flown. I bought an itinerary to fly down to DFW from SFO on Friday to Sunday of this past weekend. I then had to be down there on Thursday night, I called American to see if they could help me switch my flight, they told me it would be cheaper to just buy another flight. So I bought the second flight (also through American mind you) on Thursday night. While this was frustrating, I understood that I bought an Economy ticket and they would not roll out the red carpet for me, so I am not mad about that. I took my Thursday night flight, actual flight itself wasn't terrible. $9 cocktails is a bit high but nothing too ridiculous. After I thoroughly enjoyed most of weekend in Dallas, I tried checking into my Sunday flight on Saturday night. It said the system was down and I would have to check-in in the morning, which happened to be the morning of my nephew and Godson's baptism. I tried checking in before the service, same issue. So I called American. They cancelled my itinerary. They cancelled my itinerary because I was a ""no-show on my initial flight to Dallas."" So I was stranded after I had flown to Dallas via American because American didn't know I was in Dallas - starting to see why I am so angry? Anyway, I was forced to miss the baptism party to make sure I could get back to SFO the same night and had to be on the phone with AA customer service. The AA customer service line had zero empathy for my situation and functionally told me to ""we cant help you."" So I decided to go to the airport and try to explain myself. I have never been treated like less of a human. It seems as if American has a training to make their customer service people as cold and heartless as physically possible to the economy passengers. I was forced to buy an additional $600 ticket to get home. Then, when my co-rider had the audacity to try to get on my flight as a standby passenger they told her that she would need to buy a new ticket as well.

We waited nearly two hours before they got permission to put cargo tape on a pipe (which for some reason, they couldn't resolve before we boarded). After an additional half hour, the airplane pipe was taped and we finally took off. The attendants were on their phone for most of this time. So, no earphones for more than half the plane's passengers for any way to pass the time and take our minds off the fact that most of us were getting dangerously close to miss our connecting flights (we were in Costa Rica, traveling to Miami on our way to our final destination). When we landed, no one from AA helped those with connecting flights get through the lines quickly or showed any concern or support for their customer's schedules. After waiting in long, stressful lines where all my family and I could do was watch precious minutes slip away (and watch other fellow passengers of our flight stress in line after also being abandoned by AA), we ran to our flight and arrived 5 min before departure time only to be told that the plane had left (we could see it from the window) and that we should go to customer service. 10 min later, I watched the plane carrying our checked luggage (and our clothes and toiletries) take flight. At AA's customer service, we were subjected to a 4 hour wait despite the numerous reps behind the counter (only one was receiving customers). Finally, at midnight, we were told that the next available flight wasn't until the next evening. 3 out of 4 of us had to call out an extra day of work because of this.

Those flights got delayed, and there were no other flights to Toledo for the night. They suggested that I take the flight to Chicago and be stranded there for the night, making it very clear they would not pay for a hotel nor meals.

Again, flights kept getting delayed. I was concerned I would miss my connecting flight from Phoenix to Detroit so I asked the lady working at the gate counter about it and she spoke to me for condescending.  She wasn't good at hiding her facial expressions. She talked to me like I was a child and was wasting her time. There was nobody behind me waiting to be helped, so it is not like she was even busy. She clearly does not need to be working in customer service. After I got to Phoenix, they boarded us on time to leave for Detroit, then had us sitting on the plane delayed for almost two hours with very few updates.

So on arrival at the airport we joined the long queue for Customer Services. After several minutes a member of staff who was questioning people in the queue advised that our issue could be resolved by using one of the Self Service machines. So off to join another queue for a machine to become available. Unfortunately we were we unable to select seats or print Boarding Passes for our transatlantic flight. However we successfully managed to print off Boarding Passes for the MIA–YYZ sector. At the same time another piece of paper was output which stated that we could not print off our luggage tags as the connecting time in Toronto was too short. This despite the fact that the flights were booked over 6 months ago on the AA website. So back to the now longer queue for Customer Services. This queue moved very slowly and the number of agents dealing with passenger requests varied from two to five. Given the length of the line this was totally unacceptable. Well over two hours after arriving at the airport we actually managed to speak to someone who could help us. Our bags were eventually taken from us and tagged from MIA to YYZ to LHR. Once on board the flight was fine and departed and arrived on time. More stress at Toronto as it was not only necessary to pass through Immigration, but also pick up our bags, clear customs and then drop off the bags at the BA desk which had closed. Thankfully, a very understanding and helpful member of staff took pity on us. We managed to get to the gate just as the last passengers were boarding.

It was the worst travel experience of my life. We get to national airport and wait for the flight. I look up and notice, there is a delay. No big deal I’ve had delays before. So we wait. Finally they are boarding. We get on the plane and taxi out to the runway. We stop, pilot announces we are delayed again because we can not get air to the engine. As we sit on the runway, there is no air being circulated through the vents. It’s hot and keeps getting hotter. The woman behind me tells the flight attendant we need air, you can’t keep us on the plane like this. After an hour like this, people are sweating and feeling faint. Another woman asks if her and her infant child can get off as it’s not safe for an infant. The flight attendants reply was “sorry, we are all hot. You’ll just have to deal till we get going”. After 2 hours in the incredible heat they allow us to deplane. It was such a relief walking back to the air conditioned terminal. I wouldn’t even leave my dog in the car like that for 2 hours but I suppose American Airlines doesn’t care about leaving a whole plane in the smoldering heat. Shame on them! Another delay followed by another delay. Now I’m getting worried as I do need to be in Orlando by 8:00 that morning. I know our flight choices will be limited if they end up canceling this AA flight. I saw a flight leaving Dulles ( 20 min drive away ) 10:30 pm. I asked the gate agent should I head to Dulles or what is the likelihood this plane is leaving tonight? He said hold tight. I asked if I can get my luggage so I can have a chance at another flight. He literally said to me “if you were Nancy Pelosi or Oprah we could give you your bags”. Hmm? So because I’m not a politician or a celebrity I don’t matter? Nice AA customer service right there! So we wait. Like he said our flight did leave that evening. I think we took off around 11:00. I know we landed in Orlando by 1:30am. After getting rental car, and drive to our hotel we made it to bed by 3:00am only to be up again at 6:00am.

Frustrated I dial AA customer service to be greeted by a machine and prompted to speak to a robot till I can finally get an agent on the line. The agent tells me we can book you Tuesday or nothing at all. She is apologetic, however can’t do a thing to help me. She basically tells me that’s all I can do for you, have a nice day.

Well, the reserved seat with my name on it was no longer available, so I was forced to make another seat selection. In addition, I was forced to pay an extra $6-7 for the seat. Since I really wanted to join my family for our spring break vacation, and did not wish to miss my flight, I went ahead and bought the new seat. Fortunately the TSA officer allowed me back to the front of the line and I was able to join my family in the terminal, narrowly making the flight.

My 4 year daughter and myself were flying with our pet, and right from the rip, the customer service/baggage check in woman was super nasty. Before even looking at our pets paperwork she was telling us she couldn't fly. I gave her all the proper documentation and she still wouldn't let our dog fly. On top of that, I asked her if there if we could get a cart ride to our terminal because I am 6 months pregnant, with back issues and a 4 year old. Her response was, ""We have wheel chairs."" So we walked and low and behold, there is one of those golf carts sitting right in front of terminal, not being used. Fast track, our dog stayed behind and I contacted guest relations, as I was instructed to do. She issued us vouchers, for the incorrect amount, twice, just to find out they can not be used for pet travel. On top of that, the airline wants to charge us an additional $125 for our pet to fly since we won't be on the flight with her, totaling $325 instead of $200.

","""plagued with problems""",Kersten Hubbard,United States,12th March 2019,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  My recent trip to Jacksonville (JAX) was plagued with problems the minute I became an American Airlines passenger. I want to be clear that the first leg of my journey from Seattle to Dallas (DFW) on Alaska Airlines. I can’t say enough good things about them. I continue to be a very loyal Alaska consumer. My American Airlines 8:35pm flight from DFW to JAX backed out from the gate on time. Before entering the taxiway, the pilot came on saying there were mechanical problems and we had to return to the gate. A bit later we were told to deplane. No one was able to provide any information on whether the flight was going to continue or not. Around 930/10 pm, American announced the flight was canceled. I then headed with the 200 other passengers to the American Airlines Customer Service desk where I waited in line for over an hour. By the time I reached the desk, it was midnight. I was “automatically” put on a 5AM flight from DFW to Charlotte (CLT) then on to JAX. The customer service lady and I agreed that a hotel room would be worthless, since the flight was scheduled for 5AM. She offered me a meal voucher, which I accepted. A whole $12 voucher. $12 to spend in the airport. Unfortunately, the stores were closed and there was nowhere I could spend the $12. I spent the night in DFW waiting for a 5am flight, all due to American Airlines’ mechanical problems. At some point, I called American’s customer service to see if I could get better compensation. I was told no, $12 is it. Nothing else. Have a good night. My early AM flight was also grounded due to mechanical problems on American Airlines. While we waited on the plane, several people deplaned. Some spread out. Finally, over 2 hours after our scheduled departure, the gate agents came on to do a final head count. The count was so far off, that they made us deplane and replane. Again, more passengers abandoned the flight for other options. I was now going to miss my connection in CLT due to American Airlines’ mechanical problems. By this time, my last meal was over 24 hours ago. I was unable to eat in the airport because I either had to stay at the gate, was captive on a broken American Airlines plane, or nothing was open. The snacks American offered I could not eat due to being gluten intolerant. I finally made it to CLT, the plan leaving over 2 hours late. Fortunately, my connection was also late due to weather and not a mechanical problem (what a refreshing change). I arrived in Jacksonville 18 hours after I was supposed to and after a journey that took 36 hours instead of 12. All of this due to multiple mechanical problems on American Airlines. To add insult to injury, American clearly demonstrated that my value as a paying customer is worth all of $12 to them. However, since I was never able to use the voucher, my value to them is actually worth $0. Which is exactly what I will be giving them in the future! Journey took 36 hours and should have been 12.",Business,Economy Class,DFW to CLT via JAX,February 2019,1.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,,1,Recommendedno

We flew from Philly to Jax hole  via Chicago, a route we have done 5 other times on other airlines with no problems. On American, our flight from Chicago to Jax hole was cancelled and we got to vacation a day late. On the way home, American delayed our flight by 7 hours and then cancelled. It then booked us a day later to Columbus (we need to go to Philadelphia!). We had to talk to a gate agent to fix this and then got a route with 2 stops one in Chicago, the other in Columbus before finally getting to Philly. I don’t know how such an incompetent airline is going to get us to all of these stops in time and can’t wait to see where we get stuck tomorrow. Further evidence of american’s incompetence is that they put us up at a spring hill suites in Jax hole where the hotel had no rooms. The poor people at the hotel desk had to shuffle all kinds of things to help us. American said mechanical issues caused our first cancellation and then a “multitude of problems” caused the second delay and cancellation. Take care of your planes American and get a handle on your scheduling! If you want to get your flight cancelled and scramble go for American. They do that really well. I am never ever flying American again and will go out of my way to not fly this horrific airline. They just don’t care. A gate agent working for American told me “this happens to everyone” about all of my cancellations. That statement is so indicative of how they feel about its customers. No big deal, we will ruin your vacation, mess up your life on the way home and cost you tons of money. I should add that my previous 2 business trips were also a horrendous experience. In February 2019, I had a meeting in Orlando and American delayed the 8:55pm flight by 2 hours because the overhead bin doors were broken. How does this happen? I got to my destination at 1am. Great when you have an 8am meeting the next day. My other trip was to Indianapolis from Philly. American cancelled that flight because the crew timed out and made no effort to rebook us. I would have missed my important meeting if I relied on American. I ended up flying delta to Cincinnati and then Uber’d To Indy. Unbelievable. The last debacle that I will leave you all with is our vacation to Vail last March (2018). Also a route from Philadelphia to Dallas to vail airport. Our flight should have left at 1pm for Dallas, it was delayed 2 hours and then 2 more hours and then the flight finally took off at 7pm, so we missed our connection in Dallas to vail and as a result had to stay over in Dallas and then go to vail the next day. We got to vacation a day late. I should have learned from this experience! Never again, American. You don’t care about your customers and are a complete cluster.

","""please exercise caution""",J Meares,Canada,8th March 2019,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  This wasn't my first time flying with American airlines but it will definitely be my last. For starters, I have had more than one bad experience with them. This time, I was flying from Lafayette to a connecting flight in Dallas and then to Toronto. I always check my flight status ahead of time and there were no reported delays or changes. But for some reason, the agent at the boarding gate in Lafayette was not letting us board at our scheduled time. They gave us no information as to why we were waiting and told us we would be boarding shortly. Well, 'shortly' became at least 40 minutes. After landing in Dallas, my party and I found out the gate and terminal had changed from what was on our boarding passes and switched to the other side of the airport. After running through the crowded hallways and shouting apologies we made it to our gate which was already closed and unstaffed, about 10 minutes before our scheduled flight. At the next American airlines customer assistance counter, we were told the next available flight would be the next day. Myself and at least 10 other customers were trying to figure out how this happened as we all arrived to our first flight well ahead of the scheduled time. The agents at the service counter were saying it was coded in the system as 'delayed due to weather' ... but why then were the other similar flights, one of which departing just 10 minutes before ours, not also delayed due to weather...? How was this one flight in particular the only one delayed due to weather? Why was the online flight tracker not updated? And why was it listing our first plane as 'landed on time' in Lafayette... ? We took a step aside, and called the customer assistance number and agents over the phone were saying there was no reason listed for the delay. I took my phone back to the counter and had both agents speak to each other, who could not agree on the information they each had available. After they decided to agree-to-disagree, they informed us that their policy does not offer any accommodations for room, food or necessities. We were told the reason being that it was coded as a weather delay... Now, I was never rude or took a tone with the service agents, but they were still not helpful or empathetic to the situation, I guess they are just too used to delivering bad news. They also never offered any information about the area such as what hotels are nearby, even after we asked. At this point, I asked for a supervisor who could offer more assistance in this area, yet we were told that a supervisor would tell us the same thing, and we would be 'wasting our breath'. The only alternative we were offered was the website to American airlines, where we could send an email. This whole experience has left me quite skeptical about the information being given from American Airline and its service agents, who may use these 'codes' to protect themselves from obligations and policies they advertise to its customers. Please consider my experience as a warning for anyone looking to book any flights with AA online, and please exercise caution especially when booking connecting flights with them as they allow a minimum window of 30 minutes between connecting flights and will not accommodate you if your next flight is missed, even if they are solely responsible and the situation is out of your control.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lafayette to Toronto,March 2019,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,1,Recommendedno

AA 6018 got cancelled due to weather conditions (other airlines like Southwest didn't cancel their flights) and were booked on a new route which had a layover at Phoenix. The flights were AA 546 departing Reno at 12.45pm and landing in Phoenix at 3.28pm and AA5896 departing Phoenix at 3.56pm and landing in Long Beach at 4.15pm. You can already see how tight this layover is. The first flight was late in Phoenix by just minutes but we arrived at gate A7 and were supposed to depart at gate B16, running took 10 minutes. My sister and I caught the plane before the gate closed and were checked in but the employee who checked us in held on to my ticket in her hand while she assisted other travellers, answering their questions and letting them through. The other passengers on our first flight (AA 546) who were running towards this connecting flight (AA5896) arrived at gate B16 and the employee realised there were so many other passengers who had to board and decided to close the gate. She and the subsequent managers and other AA staff insisted that it was standard procedure to close the gates 10 mins before the flight and there was no communication from the first flight to hold this connecting flight.

Half an hour layover is clearly insufficient if passengers have to change planes and if AA flights were going to land late (it happens so frequently that it should be included in the flight time). If they told passengers that the connecting flight would be held (they told the passenger who cried), then the flight should have been held. Who lies about stuff like that?

","""glaring lack of professionalism""",Mona Swain,United States,26th February 2019,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  While the airlines cannot control the weather, they can certainly control the customer service (or lack of) that their paying customers receive. I missed my connecting flight to Greensboro from Charlotte on 2/19/2019 due to rainy, cold weather. I entered Charlotte airport at concourse A and had to depart from concourse E which is about a 12-15 minute walk. Once I was informed that plane's door was closed and could not be opened, I asked what my options were, I was told everything from ""rent a car, it's only an hour away"" to ""go stand in line"". An agent pointed at the Customer Service area which had approximately 100 people surrounding it. I was told I could either go stand in line or give the airline a call. It would have been helpful if the agents could have provided information regarding when the next flight out was scheduled, a list of hotels available in the area, or who to contact for questions. None of this was offered to me. Instead, I had to listen to a ground crew staff complain that the flight attendant let passengers disembark the plane before the ground crew were ready and watch an agent put chapstick on while he was trying to deal with upset passengers. There was a glaring lack of professionalism from almost every employee I encountered with American Airlines. It was clear that passengers missing their flight were not American Airline's problem, and agents were quick to let me know that they were under no obligations if the delay was weather-related. After the chaos had subsided, I was able to speak calmly with an agent and get a boarding pass out for the next morning. I was also able to book a room with no assistance from American Airlines. I was lucky to find a room at all and got one of the last rooms at a Best Western 15 minutes away. Once I got to the airport the next morning, the screen listed my gate as Arkansas instead of Greensboro; when I asked the agent if I was at the correct gate, she said ""hold on, I need to log out"", then proceeded to finish her conversation with her co-worker. The agent finally responded with a ""yes"" and no apologies for the screen not indicating Greensboro were offered. Greensboro was never put up on the board which caused confusion for several passengers. It was announced later that this flight was going to Greensboro, NC but Arkansas still showed as the point of destination for Gate 33 passengers as we boarded. Would it be too much to have passengers that are connecting to another flight, to disembark the plane prior to other passengers? If I had gotten to the gate 2 minutes earlier, I would have made the connection. I have flown with American many times previously and have encountered rude agents; however, the agents in Charlotte are by far the rudest. This is the last time I will look the other way and chalk up bad attitudes from agents as having a bad day. I would highly encourage American Airlines to provide customer service training to your staff. I will not recommend this airline to my co-workers nor my family, as I would not want anyone to experience such a disregard for simple human kindness and courtesy.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Greensboro,February 2019,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Recommendedno

I attempted to check in online 18 hours prior to my flight. For whatever reason, the system processed mine but not my wife's. Since in the inbound flight we weren't seated together, I wanted to rectify this. I called AA and the first agent who answered immediately suggested it was my fault because I ""didn't check a box or something"". I suggested he first listen to me and run my record locator. All I wanted to do was ensure me. And my wife sat together this time. When he did, he said this is an issue with British Airways since they issued the ticket. I said that's impossible, because BA doesn't handle check in for flights on AA. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was told to call BA or they could put me in touch with their website tech support (why?). Both the initial agent as well as the supervisor were incredibly rude and appeared to be doing whatever possible to get me off the line. I called BA. The agent, Dev, went above and beyond what could possibly be expected, and stayed with me for an hour to help. I explained what happened and he told me they're ""giving you the run around"" because, of course, BA doesn't handle check in for domestic AA flights. He offered to call AA for me and we were on a conference call. The supervisor he spoke to informed him that there was an issue with the passport info. He asked them to change the info and complete checkin and was told that was impossible. He said he knows for a fact it isn't, and it happens all the time. Since checkin wasn't my issue, but seating, he suggested my wife simply be given a seat next to me and she would complete checkin at the airport. The AA supervisor said that, too, was impossible. Until she's checked in, they can't assign a seat. Once again, the BA agent explained that this is impossible and he has lists of policies and regulations, not to mention previous experience. The AA supervisor hung up on him mid sentence. He apologized profusely and said he never experienced anything like this. We called again, and the agent we got this time was just as unhelpful and refused to do anything, but was at least pleasant. She suggested I pay to select my wife's seat, because next to me there is an empty one. The BA agent again asked why they can't assign it to her, it's within 24 hours of the flight. No. They won't assign it, they won't fix her checkin, but they're happy to SELL the seat. At this point in my frustration I said fine, I'll buy it. $50 additional fee if the agent takes my payment. Both me and the BA agent were at a loss for words. I ended up going online to buy the seat next to me for my wife, with Dev and the AA supervisor on hand to confirm it went through. AA succeeded in ruining my last day in Honolulu and wasting 2 hours of my time in order to squeeze even more money out of me. I would have thought that would be it, but upon arrival at Heathrow, I learned my bags didn't make the flight (2hr layover at LAX). This airline is an absolute joke, with complete disregard for passengers. Even the discount carriers treat you better. BA offered a black and white comparison between how an airline should behave and how it shouldn't.

As a precursor, I am a consistent traveler and have flown through just about every airline, experienced delays/cancellations, ect. As long as customer service present, I’m understanding and compliant. Unfortunately, the customer service experience element of AA wasn’t present today. To start, I received an email update our initial flight to our connecting flight was going to be delayed. Then we received another notification that it was delayed again. This second delay made us too late to make our connecting flight. We called and spoke to a representative from American Airlines and he said ALL flights were going to be canceled due to weather. This seemed shocking, so we hung up and called back. The second person said some flights were delayed, but not ALL canceled. We decided to go to the airport to see what options were available. Initially our first question was, “With this delay, will our connecting flight be delayed?” She said it was going to be on time and we would definitely miss is. She began suggesting alternative plans. We asked if we could transfer to other flights, she said she had nothing. We asked for other airlines, she said they had nothing. We asked to change our arrival city to be Detroit instead of Flint (Essentially we were trying to come up with solutions and she just stood there waiting for us to ask the right question to solve the problem—offering no suggestions of her own) Finally with that idea, she confirmed that was available. Okay, great. We went with that option. We had to wait at least 20 minutes for American Airline to book us a hotel and she emphasized it was the best option because of the 24 hr shuttle service which is perfect since we had a 5am flight. As soon as we get settled in the hotel, I receive an email notification that our connecting flight was delayed. I called and we could not get back on that flight and now obligated to take the new flight out the next day... We arrive to the hotel, check in and there is no 24 hr shuttle(after we were told there would be). We are told we have to provide our own transportation because we had an early flight. I called American Airlines to see if they could correct this, they said no, but we could file a claim. Next morning, we arrive back at the airport after we had to find a way to get there and our tickets had been voided. (What?!) They said our tickets had been changed/edited 11 times before it was finally just canceled! So, now we’re tired and frustrated because we were ill advised as to which flight to get on, no shuttle, had to pay for our own transportation, had to pay for a rental vehicle, and had to still pay for our seats and baggage check in. I’m not upset that I had to pay for seats and luggage or transportation and etc, I’m upset there was no customer service with this airline.

This review is based on my unfortunate experience with American Airlines starting the day of February 7th, 2019. I was travelling with 4 other female medical students from Toronto to Haiti to complete a week-long mission trip in Cap-Haitien. While boarding our connecting flight in Miami, we received word from Haiti that the country was now under protest and rioting in the streets and there were no vehicles allowed on the roads. There were barricades blocking the road to and from the airport and they could not find a company to pick us up. We immediately notified the AA gate staff and were assured that there was nothing going on in Haiti and it was safe to fly into. They were actually arrogant in their attitude and stated, “obviously we would know if something was going on, we wouldn’t fly into Haiti if there was.” They made us feel like we were stupid children. After boarding, we begged the American Airline attendant to please speak to the pilot to contact the Cap-Haitien airport and verify the information we received. Within minutes he returned explaining that they had heard nothing was going on. At that point, we had to trust the airline and flew into Haiti. Upon arrival, our worst nightmare came true. The country was in violent protests, rioting and fires everywhere. We could not get out of the airport. It didn’t take long for AA to rid themselves of any responsibility and they flew out, taking any hope we had of getting out with them. The airport tried to shuttle us out on an escorted shuttle, but we got attacked and had to return to the airport. Shortly thereafter, the airport closed. We had to either sleep outside the airport or try and pay someone to escort us safely out. We did the latter and ended up having to go to a hotel in the hills, away from our compound, clinic, and the patients we came to help. After 2 risky attempts where we had to return to the airport after getting stones and glass thrown at us, we reached our hotel. Fast forward to 4 days of trying to get back to the airport and out of Haiti, we called American Airlines several times to please come back and get the people who were left stranded there. We were told repeatedly that this was not their problem and that we could change our flights but at a cost. After several days and attempts to get past the fires, barricades and violence on the streets, we were able to get to the airport and catch a flight out. We were told verbatim that as long as it didn’t interfere with their flight pattern, what was happening on the ground in Haiti was not their problem. The hardest, and scariest thing to believe is that there was apparently no communication between the airports. I mean, it’s a freaking phone call!!

Im a frequent traveler and I have pretty minimal expectations when it comes to flying economy. However, Americans Airlines does not meet any standards as far as timeliness or customer service. My first flight was delayed because we did not have any flight attendants. They were leaving the airport within minutes if boarding time. The gate attendants made their frustrations pretty clear. Actually- between both crews, the employees were speaking very unprofessionally within earshot. Even worse, this delay was because the flight attendants had “required” rest from a three hour delay the night prior. They could not begin the shift and we cannot board without them. If this was known in advance, why was the flight not delayed or alternate attendants provided? The gate ladies were livid at the lack of communication by AA. I nearly missed my connection. On my second flight, there were mechanical issues. This was announced after the left the gate and we had to turn around. We were stuck in the plane. Even worse- I was in the back row next to the toilet (which was being frequently used with the delay) and the woman in front of me was sick. She was sneezing, coughing, blowing her nose. The couple next to me moved To the other side of the plane. There were 10+ Empty middle seats on the plane. I said I was afraid of getting sick and sensitive to the smell of the toilet. I asked if I could move like the couple did and the attendant said no. I paid the base rate for my ticket. Group 9 can’t move around seats.

No chance of a second cup of coffee. Fruit plate was barely acceptable as most of the fruit was not ripe.

","""one nightmare after another""",P Kealy,United States,9th January 2019,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Vail via Dallas Ft Worth. This entire trip was one nightmare after another. On my outbound flight, I sat in the plane at the gate for over 2 hours for a maintenance issue involving some kind of latch in the cargo area. That was frustrating, but I would prefer the plane be safe prior to takeoff, so I accepted it and moved on. My return trip was one issue after another. I was notified of a 2 hour delay about 5 hours prior to the scheduled departure time. While I was never given a formal reason for this original delay, it was suspected to be as a result of weather in other parts of the country. I was understanding but still needed to know how to handle the ticket for my missed connection flight. The attendant at the desk advised me to still remain on this flight and the connection ticket would be handled for me once it was ""officially missed."" I did so and continued waiting. The plane was delayed for a little longer than originally planned but it did finally arrive at the airport. Unfortunately, yet another plane had maintenance issues and the delay was extended by another 1.5 hours for them to check it out. The departure time was 4 hours and 17 minutes late. I had been rescheduled onto several intermediate flights but, ultimately, missed all connections due to another delay upon arrive at DFW - we were not able to get to a gate so we were waiting in the holding box for an additional 20 minutes. I was finally booked onto the last flight between Dallas and Houston for the night, so I went to the gate to wait the 1.5 hours. While waiting, the flight was ""delayed"" by 30 minutes, and the shortly after that announcement, it was cancelled altogether. After waiting in line at the AA customer service desk for 30 minutes, I was informed that they had not scheduled a flight crew for that flight, which is why it was cancelled. So I had to be put up in a hotel and fly out the following morning. The airline dropped the ball in numerous ways, but the poor state of their planes is the most concerning. I finally contacted them after it was all finished and requested compensation for the nightmare that I went through and the airline offered me a $100 ""goodwill"" voucher to fly American again in the next 12 months. I do not accept that as sufficient compensation so I continued emailing back and forth, ultimately ending with a phone call from corporate customer relations saying that this was all that I was entitled to since they provided the service that I paid for - a flight between the two destinations. I am shocked that multiple delays and hours spent in airports waiting for their mechanics to get the planes in fit condition to fly amounts to $100 on an airline that I have no intention of ever flying again if there is any alternative. I've flown Spirit airlines multiples times and had better customer service than American provided. I advise you to steer clear and avoid American Airlines if at all possible.

We used our loyalty program to book tickets with American. United is the hub where we live, but we have chosen American for what used to be its service. The program apparently has so many rules that when we arrived in Charlotte, NC trying to get back to Detroit, there was an earlier flight. American would not allow us to get on the flight even though the plane was half full. The company preferred to make its loyal customers wait for six hours until its next, probably half full flight leaves for Detroit. I waited at the gate for the agent who never showed. The pilot, who was waiting too, politely told me that I could go to the customer service desk to get help. When I arrived there, two of my original five passengers were somehow on this flight. Interesting that they had to fly back already allowing American to resell their seats, saving them two 850 vouchers at our original departure city. The agent at customer service told me I had to call a number to get help. The agent at the number couldn't help. But her supervisor at Dallas Fort Worth asked why I hadn't talked to a supervisor at the gate. I politely told her that I was told to call this number. She told me we could fly standby but the agent had to reset her documentation which is fine print for not wanting to take the heat. Every single time each employee said they couldn't break the rules - he/she was not going to get written up for breaking the rules. I wonder when helping loyal customers became breaking rules.

Another deeply disappointing experience with American, and this time it involves an illegal, deceptive sales method. Purchased a so-called ""basic economy"" ticket from LAX to Bucharest at a not so basic price. This allows me to check in 24-hours in advance and obtain the best seats then available. Was unable to check-in online and was told it is because I am flying on BA to Romania. Romania is a EC member-country just like France, England, & Germany and also does not require a visa of US-citizens, so I do not understand this pretext. I was told to drive out to LAX and check-in tomorrow when there is nothing left but middle seats in the back. I protested and then learnt the real reason my check-in is restricted: they advised me to purchase seat assignments online for more than $100. When I protested further the agent told me it was my own fault for buying ""basic economy,"" but I responded that the real error here is patronising American Airlines. This is what is called by the FTC ""bait-and-switch"" and it is illegal. I am dreading this trip now because of this and the 3-hour connexion on BA - the last time I flew AA to London and then a BA flight to Düsseldorf my suitcase was delayed for two hours but it took BA five days to bring it to me and by that time I was on my way back to the airport to continue my journey - they then tried to negotiate me down on my modest interim expenses.

If you are able to, I would avoid American Airlines if it is possible for you to. First, the flight was delayed because their defroster wasn't working, which could have been avoided by them warming it while we were boarding, rather than waiting till we had been sitting for awhile to defrost it! So we sat there for about twenty minutes until they finally got their defroster out and then we had to wait another hour for them to fix the defroster. Because of this, I missed my connecting flight in Chicago. The only positive thing about American Airlines is that they re-booked my flight automatically after the delay. But the next flight wasn't for another seven hours! Then, once I boarded the next flight, we sat for an hour again because there was ""traffic"" from the other airplanes. American Airlines was just a mess as you can see. Not to mention, completely unprofessional. While on the first flight (flying to Chicago), I saw the flight attendant on his phone while he was supposed to be handing out refreshments to people and they were very lazy. Two of the three flight attendants sat for most of the flight.

A snowstorm unexpectedly hit Albuquerque and Dallas, and the evening before our flight we got a phone call that it was canceled. I was very thankful for getting this information prior to arriving at the airport the next morning, and American was able to rebook us the following day on the exact same flights. Weather delays and issues arise, and as regular travelers, we understand this. My husband, four children, and I arrived at the Albuquerque airport about 20 minutes before 5 AM for our flight to Dallas that was at 6:45 (we like to hit security about an hour before our flight). There was already a very long line of about 150 people waiting to be checked in. Almost all of the kiosks were broken and not working and the ones that were working would not process our tickets because of the prior day's last minute flight changes from the airline. Our kiosk actually asked for us to get a worker to help us process our tickets at the kiosk, and when I asked the woman checking in kiosk bags if we should wait for her to help us, or if we should get in the line she started yelling at us to get on a different kiosk, that they don't all work out it wasn't her fault. I think they were maybe 3 working kiosks at that point. Only 2 workers were checking in standard tickets, 1 was 1st class only (and mostly standing doing nothing), and another was checking bags from the few who got the kiosks to work. After waiting in the line for over 2 hours, as we approached the front of the line, 1 of the desk workers began yelling at the crowd that it was our fault that we had missed our flights and we should have been there hours earlier. My husband responded to her and told her that the crowd had not all missed their flights because of being late but because of the inability of the airline to handle the delays from the day before. She began screaming at us that we should all know to arrive over 3hrs early for any flight. That maybe recreational travelers don't understand these things. The entire crowd of now 250 people behind us yelled wow at her and she proceeded to turn to the security guard and make a comment about having my husband removed. Thankfully the security guard shook his head no at her. She told us that it was all over the website that we needed to be there over 3 hrs early. When looking at the website to verify, there was no mention of needing to be there 3hrs prior and nothing under the alert section either. I believe there were well over 300 people waiting in line to check in at one point. Once we got to the counter almost an hour after our flight was supposed to leave, we were refused ticketed seats for the 6 of us on flights and put on standby rather than give a new tickets because this was ""our fault"" for missing the flight. They also tried to make us pay $250 a ticket to get new flights because again it was ""our fault"" and not theirs. The six of us entered security at 7:40, (exited it less than 8 minutes later), after being at the airport almost exactly 3 hours.

Check in and bag drop were easy as a Premium Economy customer can use Priority where the lines are very short. This is conveniently located next to the Priority TSA security lane that I was able to use so I was airside in MIA about 15 mins after dropping my bag. Once airside, because I'm a Oneworld Sapphire cardholder, I was eligible to use a lounge. Whilst AA has more than one lounge in MIA I headed for the best one which is the Flagship Lounge. Lots of space and different seating areas and points for food and beverage to avoid bottlenecks. The hot food was superb and indulged in a little bit of this together with some champagne and really good Californian red wine. About a 5 min walk to board and most others had already boarded so there was no line at the gate, even though I had priority boarding if needed. The Premium Economy cabin is small, only 3 or 4 rows, with a bathroom right in front of the first row. I had no problem placing my hand baggage in the locker. The seats are very new and comfortable. I flew out Main Cabin Extra (MCE) just a few days earlier so could easily compare the seating. The IFE screen is noticeably bigger than coach as is the width of the seat. The legroom is very comfortable, with a foot rest, but to be honest only a couple of inches more than MCE, but several more than Main Cabin. The Premium Economy recline is really good, so you can create a fairly relaxed seating position overall. Proper ear surrounding headsets give a better sound offering for the movies, which are the same as offered in coach. We were offered drinks and pretzels within 30 mins of departure and the offering was the same as coach. Not much time passed before the main meal came out with more drinks. The food presentation was good, solid crockery and metal cutlery. But after this point, is where it fell flat. The main course appears to be bespoke for Premium Economy, presumably as an enhanced offering. A number of my fellow passengers had pre-ordered special dietary meal. There is also an option to pre-order your main meal even if not for dietary reasons. I had not done this. As a result I was offered no choice and given this bland, tasteless, protein free vegetable risotto. It is the most disappointing long haul inflight main course meal I have had in all my travels. Even more so because I was in Premium Economy. Thank goodness I'd earlier eaten in their Flagship Lounge.  About an hour before arrival a light breakfast was served consisting of a fresh fruit plate, banana yoghurt and a small cinnamon pastry with tea or coffee and juices. This was fine, although a hot beverage refill would have been welcome. Despite the disappointing dinner, with the good seat comfort I got about 5 hours sleep. Bag delivered promptly at Heathrow with no issues. My verdict on AA Premium Economy: slick on the ground, very comfortable in the air, but didn't see the premium in the food and beverage offering.

By the time I remembered, my seat on my outbound flight was an isle and on the return flight a middle. Although I am slightly claustrophobic, I felt I could manage the return if I kept my mind busy. Well, I was wrong. I will remember my return flight today forever. While waiting for my boarding group number to load, the airline informed us they were looking for 10 people to give up their seats as they were overbooked. They offered a $1,000 voucher. Wanting to get home sooner, I boarded the flight and sat down in my middle seat after the isle passenger moved aside. Once I sat down and with the other passenger next to me, my claustrophobia kicked in and my heart started to accelerate. I felt a cold sweat and a feeling of being trapped. I tried hard to read a book but knew after 1 minute that it wasn't working. I asked the passenger to get up and quickly exited the seat. I rushed up to the stewardess and told her I had a problem. I explained I was having a panic attack due to the middle seat position and my claustrophobia. She immediately looked me in the eye and told me everything would be fine. She told me her father also had the same fear. She helped me out of the plane past the line of entering passengers and told me to take deep breaths. She then went back inside the plane and asked the passenger in the isle seat if they minded moving to the middle. Unfortunately they said no, so she took my carry on bag and escorted me back to the check-in area to be placed in an isle seat on another plane. Now the story does not end there. Because the plane was overbooked, a passenger seated on the isle in the emergency row decided to deplane. Rather than placing another passenger in that seat they brought me back in the plane. The flight was wonderful and I had no further anxiety problems. I even got home on time to see my family. I feel American Airlines and the stewardess went above and beyond. I will remember the kindness they showed me today for the rest of my life.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Philadelphia,November 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,Recommendedyes

","""poor experience from end to end""",C Rasmussen,United States,18th November 2018,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Freeport via Miami. Absolute poor experience from end to end. When we checked in, the boarding passes didn’t work when we entered security. Our re-check-in was done with an attitude of me not understanding how things work - which isn’t very customer service minded. After we arrived at our destination, 2 of 3 checked in luggage’s missed our flight (we had 2.5h layover) and was not found until the day after. Neither of these experiences were managed well, and no one (!!) from the additional assistance during check-in (and re-check-in) to the baggage service representative (via phone) had any empathy or a customer service mentality. Please note, we were traveling with an infant. On the way back to our home, we experienced an unpleasant situation while boarding the first airplane. We were kindly asked to check in a carry on at the counter, and we explained that our carry on had baby equipment required for a long layover (blankets, harness etc.). A classical superviser-type (by attitude) employee from AA interrupted the conversation, without any respect of existing explanation (or emphathy for that matter), and ordered us to check in our carry on. If we did not, she told us we wouldn’t be allowed to board the airplane. “Next flight you’re taking is at 6PM” was her exact words. This was said without even trying to solve our issue! It contributed to the unpleasant situation we experienced at the gate. Worth mentioning we were flying with carry on allowed as part of our ticket. We unwillingly gave up our carry on (incl. important baby stuff) only to discover that half of the overhead bins were empty when boarding was complete. I am frequently using AA for business trips - it’s though no longer my first choice when other options are available. Participated in the post flight questionnaires provided by AA.

After that, we were told we were waiting for a flight from Philadelphia to get to Boston and they would have boarded us there.

Well some crew members got to the airport and boarded the 4.50pm flight that was waiting in the parking since 6pm. We were told that another crew was on their way and our flight would have taken off at 10pm. At 10.30pm we were told we wouldn’t be able to go to Miami and our flight was cancelled. No refund, no hotel provided because it was “weather related” when really it was because American Airlines couldn’t get the crew to the airport. At that point it wasn’t even raining in Boston. If this wasn’t enough, the personnel at the desk was incredibly rude. They lied to us multiple times regarding the status of the flight, they told us the problem was the weather when all the other flights were taking off from Boston, just not to provide us with reimbursement.

After running to the terminal, we learned that there was an electronic issue aboard flight 556 to Phoenix that they working to resolve. This announcement was repeated over the next two hours. The next announcement said that the plane was out of order and they were looking for another flight. Then another announcement saying that was incorrect and that they were still working to fix the original electronic issue. After another hour goes by we were all given hotel vouchers and were booked on the same flight for the next morning at 9:00. We arrived at the terminal on time for the flight. After a thirty min delay, an announcement arrived that the pilots had not arrived. Then another 30 min: “there is an electronic issue.” After another two hours they said that the plane was out of service. We were told that all remaining flights to Phoenix were full and we were routed to customer service.

In short, multiple occasions of poor communication at the airport, cancelled flights with hit an miss support, delayed bags after confirming they were on the flight, & rude employees during and after trip. My problem isn't as much that bad things happened, but how many and how the airline handled the situations. I even filled out the the survey that American Airlines sent me. Due to my responses, I expected that I would have been contacted by now (3 weeks later) with al least an email apologizing for the problems I had and appreciation for flying with them. As a result I feel it is important to share with others my experience. The problems started with a series of gate changes that had me bouncing around the airport at DFW. At one point there were people from 4 different flights at a gate trying to figure out if it was the gate they were supposed to be at. The monitors at the most of the gates did not show any information about the flight that was upcoming. This added to the confusion for my flight and others. Eventually my flight was cancelled. The next flight wasn't available till late morning the next day. The person at the gate was able to re-route my flight so I could meet up with the group I was going to road trip with. I received a hotel voucher for my overnight stay. When I called the hotel shuttle to pick me up, they informed me that they wouldn't send a shuttle. I told them I had a voucher from the airline for my stay. The hotel said that it didn't matter and I would need to talk to the airline for different arrangements. Many American Airlines employees & 4 hours later, I was finally on my way to a hotel I would have to pay for myself and submit a refund from the airline. Another person on the shuttle had many difficulties as he didn't have a cell phone to get messages about gates changing and flights cancelling. The lack of announcements and information at the gates was a serious concern. Once at my hotel, I called to confirm that my baggage would be rerouted with me to my new destination. The employee submitted a request, but said I would want to arrive early at the airport and talk to the baggage people in person. I arrived several hours prior to my flight and approached the baggage assistance counter. I stood at the counter being ignored by the employee for several minutes before she acknowledged my presence. She then asked me to wait a few minutes. When she was ready for me, I explained my situation, she seemed pretty annoyed, but she did pulled up my information and said that my bags are marked to be with me.

","""the worst airline I've used""",D Porter,United States,4th November 2018,Not Verified,Not Verified |  Two thumbs down for American Airlines. I flew American round trip from San Francisco to Costa Rica recently and though there were a few redeeming moments with them on the whole I would never recommend or choose American. Of the 4 flights (connecting included) there were stressful delays on each one and re-routing and departure time changes which added considerable travel time and made me miss appointments. My main complaint is that American seems to use scented air freshener in their cabin air system which every hour or so would come blasting through into the cabin. I happen to be physically very sensitive to chemical air fresheners and I know for certain that there are many people who are sensitive. We are trapped in the capsule at the mercy of someones decision to use this toxic scent (whatever it is). I got off the plane feeling ill and with lung irritation. My partner could smell it on me when giving me a ride home. He too is sensitive and it gave him a headache just from my clothing. It seems we are living in a new culture of air scenting from laundry detergent to garbage bags and everything in between. Hopefully they will realize that this is a bad move. Also because of their delay in one of my days of travel I did not have time to eat in my connection airport as I had to run to the gate. I was prepared to purchase food on board the 2nd flight of my journey only to find out they didn't have food to purchase (between Dallas and San Jose) which was the longest leg of my flight. Instead they had a wimpy and junk food like snack offering. What was with that? Also the headphone jack was broken on one of my flights so I couldn't use the onboard entertainment for a 6 hour flight.

I checked the AA website and saw that a note that the flight was delayed 30 minutes, but I did not receive an email alert. We went to the assigned gate and 20 minutes before scheduled take off, it was announced that our flight was delayed, the gate was changed, and the plane was changed. Our seats, which I selected and paid $282 for extra leg room (it was a 7.5 hour flight), were not honored and we were assigned seats in the rear of the plane where we could enjoy the roar of the engines and a hint of jet fuel for the duration of the flight. AA's code sharing partner, British Airways, also foisted the ""change of plane"" and doomed us to horrible seats. I have a suspicion there was some consolidation of flights going on here. I checked the flight the day before and many seats were still available. The upshot of this is that I believe that AA changed to a plane with fewer seats and that our ""guaranteed"" seats were not honored.

It's now #2 on the list of worst airlines I ever used (#1 is Wamos, a Spanish airline). Their personnel on the ground (and in the air) is actually pretty helpful and their machines fairly simple to use, at least from my experience. But it's once you're onboard that you realize your mistake. I paid $1030 for a flight from LA to Reading and back, the same price I would pay for a trip to Europe, which is twice the distance. You'd think for that price you can get a minimum quality, even on economy. Wrong. For a start, you pay $30 for your first check-in luggage, and it grows exponentially! Totally outrageous. What this does, it makes everybody bringing carry-ons, overcharging the cabin with carry-on luggage, making it hard to find space above your seat for your luggage, so you have to put it in a totally different area (what a hassle to get it when you exit the plane!). No food for the whole flight (Yes, AA, I don't call food a couple of pretzels and a soda). If you want food, you have to pay for it. And what kind of food! Then, there is the entertainment: just as it seems to become a trend on the worst airlines, American Airlines forces you to use your own devices to be able to watch their programs. In their penny pinching minds, they automatically assume that everyone has a smart phone, or a tablet, or a computer. If you don't have any device on you, or your device is not compatible with their system (more on that later), you're out of luck. But the incredible part is, they don't even provide any electric plug or USB for you to plug in your devices! So, if all you have to watch movies onboard is your smartphone (which is already pitiful), and you need your phone battery fully charged for when you arrive at your final destination and need to call your friends, taxis, hotels, etc., again, you're out of luck. Now, let's talk about device compatibility with their onboard movie/TV system, which uses Flash Player. I did have a fully updated version of Flash Player on my computer, but their system kept saying it was not updated. After several attempts, since they were offering to download their own updated version of Flash Player, I decided to uninstall my version and replace it with theirs. Guess what? It still would not work. Their system would not recognize its own version of Flash Player on my machine! Unbelievable. I uninstalled and re-installed the app again, tried everything to get it to connect. Nothing worked. I spent the whole trip with no entertainment. Also, the cabin remained pitch black the whole time (you could barely see where you walked) which was very hard on your eyes when people constantly turned on their individual light or their computer screen. When we got to the luggage claim area at the airport, no indication anywhere of which carousel it was. When we finally found it, the previous plane had not even started their download, which made us wait for an extra hour. To top it off, I was carrying fragile items in a separate box. American Airlines made me pay an extra $200 (one way) because it was oversize. But the best part: they didn't put it with the oversize luggage (that are usually handled with a bit more care), they put it with the regular ones. Nothing was broken, but the whole experience really made me furious. The irony in all this is: AA is one of the only airline companies to wear the name: American. Aren't you ashamed, guys?

I knew what I was getting into - no checked bag, no seat selection, boarding last - so there were no surprises. My expectations were low, and AA exceeded them generally. AA will not give you a boarding pass for flight segments until you arrive at that airport which is moderately annoying, but that was the only issue for me. There was plenty of overhead bin space on the international segments for my bag. I had a middle seat CLT-FCO but had an aisle seat MPX-MIA. Food was decent as was the on-board service. IFE gets low marks because there was no AVOD at all on the nearly 10 hour flight MXP-MIA. Apparently the 767-300 refurbs have not gone that far per a flight attendant. Also, in Economy there are no power ports; so your devices will quickly run out of juice. Bring an old-school paper book!

After experiencing a steady trend over the past several years in upward ticket prices and frequency of delay, I thought it was time to leave a review of American Airlines. I have recently experienced so many delays, resulting in missed connections, that I now find it preferable to fly to an airport 3 hours from my destination and drive the remainder. That is how unreliable airlines have become. Today, my flight has been delayed for two hours (so far), with a series of 3 increasing delay emails that began with a shorter predicted delay. After finding no information online about the reason for this delay (when airlines are usually eager to blame weather so everyone knows it's not their fault) I contacted customer service to inquire as to the nature of the delay. I was told ""maintenance issues"" after being on hold for over 10 minutes. I am writing this review in part to suggest a number of changes that AA could make to their service to dissuade negative reviews such as this: 1. If a delay is due to something that is the fault of the airline, and not the weather, state this honestly on flight status pages. 2. Maybe offer a voucher or other compensation when delays that are YOUR FAULT exceed two hours. Even something minor—like a seat upgrade or free wifi—would be better than nothing, and deter disgruntled passengers from boycotting your airline (which I am seriously considering at this point in time). 3. Change the ""on hold"" music to something with slightly better sound quality. Also, we do not need to be reminded of AA advertisements and ""Please continue waiting"" every 30 seconds. This is incredibly distracting and irritating when people are already irritated. 4. On your website's ""Your Trip"" section, clearly display the arriving aircraft's departure status, so that customers can click on the delayed flight and see where it's coming from and whether it's departed. This is an incredibly obvious thing that helps patrons gauge how long a delay is likely to last, or whether a cancellation is imminent. Other airlines already do this, but AA forces people to use better flight tracker services to check the status of the arriving aircraft. Unless some of these things change, I will not be using American Airlines any longer, and will recommend all of my friends, family and colleagues do the same.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Charlotte,October 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Recommendedno

I missed my connection in Philadelphia due to a maintenance issue on the plane. I landed at 8:52pm and was told by customer service in Philadelphia the next flight out was not until the next morning at almost 9:00am. I was looking at a 12 hour layover so obviously I wanted to stay in a hotel. I was told I would have to pay out of pocket by customer service.

After the customer service agent agreed to give me a free hotel stay she said all of the vouchers were already given out. She then told me I could purchase my own and I would be reimbursed. There is a hotel attached to the Philadelphia airport and their cheapest room was $313. After taxes and fees it came out to $364. Since I was told I was getting a reimbursement I didn't think it mattered how much I paid. At that point I purchased my own hotel and the next day e-mailed American Airlines for my reimbursement. An agent e-mailed me the next day telling me I would not be getting a refund. After arguing my case over e-mail and the phone I was then told I would be getting $120 back. I have been trying for days to get the rest of the reimbursement but have been told multiple times the maximum reimbursement for hotel stays are $120.

Our flight from Philadelphia (which was a stopover) to Madrid was delayed because the IT people did not cross check the numbers against those on the actual plane. The delay was for more than 2hrs. Then an AA customer manager comes onboard and promises everyone on the plane that all our connection flights will be rescheduled automatically to the next available time by the time we reach Mardid. This was a plain outrageous lie. We were standing in an enormously long line at the AA desk at Madrid airport where basically all passengers from this flight went to, trying to get their connecting flights rearranged. Because nothing was arranged for anyone. In addition, we were told that all flights to the island were booked and they could not accommodate us on that day (we arrived around 10am in the morning). so they booked us for the next (!) day and put us in a hotel. Only the AA agent 'forgot' to tell us that there were NO SEATS and NO GUARANTEE that we were going to fly the next day! We nearly did not make it the next day because the flight was FULL! We had to wait with a little kid until everyone boarded and basically begged the staff to let us in. In addition, this flight was at 9pm which meant that we lost 2 days in Madrid, away from our main destination. In addition, our hotel in Tenerife did not cancel our missed day and we had to pay extra 500 Euros for the day we were not there. When we emailed the AA and asked them to reimburse us for the missed hotel day, cab rides that we did not intend to take, they rejected it stating that we simply had an inconvenience and nothing more than that. I am glad that we did not waste our money booking first class seats. Terrible AA agents across the board, whether in person in different countries, on email or on the phone!

As uncharacteristic as it is for me to rant via social media, I think my years of airline travel and airline frustration have officially come to a head. In traveling to see my wife for our 1 year anniversary, I made the mistake of choosing American Airlines for the final time. In the last two years my wife and I have flown with them, we've had nothing but issues. Lost baggage, overcharged baggage fees for bags even while on military orders (which most airlines waive), being removed from flights because of the possibility of our connectors potentially not arriving on time, and just a general sense of ""I dont care and you're a nobody"" exuded from the employees. Finally, we have today's ordeal. I arrived at Sacramento International at a little past 7 am. My flight was scheduled to depart at 8:05 am. I arrived at the ticketing area at 7:18, and after a couples minutes of finding my record number, I began to punch in my numbers. At 7:21 am, I was told that I had the choice of either getting on a later flight or departing with carry-on only. Not knowing exactly what the issue was, I went to the counter where I was told that I was too late to travel with bags (by one minute), so I would have to be placed on standby for the next flight 4 hours later. This would delay my final arrival time by 6 hours. At this point I very politely asked if there was any way I could make this flight, being that I was only 1 minute past the 45-minute deadline. I was told that I had to travel with my bags and that they couldn't take my bag due to this 45-minute rule and that I couldn't just have them take it and wait for it to arrive on a later flight. I begged for them to make an exception so I wouldn't placed on standby, but I was told that there was nothing they could do, which means that my entire first-anniversary weekend is currently hanging in the balance because of 1 single minute. Needless to say, I had no choice but to take the later flight and I will now spend the rest of the day hoping there is a spot for me, which brings me to this. How, in a time of jobs being lost to automation, can a company insist on being so rigid that no employee can use basic customer service skills to work this out? If their hands are so tied that they can't override something as minuscule as this, what can they do? And if they do have this ability, what song and dance is required to get said employees to just let it go? It seems that there is a serious issue with this company in almost every way except two: maintenance and the pilots. I can only attest to those two being quality due to the fact that, in the time I have traveled with American Airlines, the planes have always made it in one piece and I'm alive to write this. I just believe it's time that American Airlines finds a way to do better. If my wife and I have dealt with this numerous times, all within the last 18 months, how many times has this happened to others? I know you are probably thinking, ""Mike, just fly with another airline,"" and from now on, I'll respond, ""I sure will.""",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sacramento to Dallas Ft Worth,October 2018,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2,Recommendedno

I rarely fly AA and will avoid doing so at all costs in the future. While the rate was decent, that was the only positive experience out of 4 flights. The trip was from the US to London via Dallas going, and Charlotte returning. AA was the operator for British Airways for the first 3 legs. For check-in, I attempted to do this via the mobile app and online. The message I got was that since they are operating the flight for BA, that I needed to do check in with BA, and gave me an option to redirect to their site. Fine. But once there, BA said I had to check in with AA. Anyone see the problem here? Not having the ability to check in electronically is incredibly stupid in the year 2018. Checking in at PDX was fine, as I was at least able to use the kiosk. Checking in for the return trip at Heathrow was not fine. The kiosk took me through the entire process and gave a message at the end stating I had to see a customer service representative. To say that these reps were slow would be an understatement. It took them 45 minutes to process the roughly 5 people / groups ahead of me. 45 minute delay at an already notoriously slow airport. Thanks, AA. On-board, I would characterize the attitudes of the flight attendants as varying between indifferent and rude. They don't seem to be trained that they are in the business of serving customers, not belittling them. I felt like a number, when other airlines seem to treat people with respect. Getting bags was a chore as well, as AA doesn't seem to care about connection times, and takes a really long time to get bags out onto the conveyor. Other airlines can do this faster, so why can't AA? One can only guess they don't really care. Avoid AA. There are options out there.

I first thought well this sucks. My second thought was i have a ton of time to sit here. My third thought was why was I not notified of this delay? Fourth thought, why is the plane delayed so long? Fifth thought, would if this plane never takes off. I find myself over to the American counter, a huge line of people who also we not notified of the delay stand waiting for the attendant to hopefully find a new route for them home. People in line said their flight had been canceled over 24 hours and they had to stay in a motel and received a food voucher, other people said their plane on the way in had been delayed over 13 hours and their whole trip was ruined because they missed out on precious time. I started panicking I did not want to be stuck in Canada all day and night. I was running out of clean clothes and second I didn’t want to have to eat out another meal. I asked the attendant she said I had to wait to speak with someone as it was her second day and she had no idea why the plane had been delayed. Some customer service they have. I had a better idea to call. Once patched through to a human being and not an automated message the lady told me the estimated time was to depart at 1pm. I told her there is no guarantee it’ll take off and by the sounds of it it probably won’t because no one ever even reached out to say it was delayed. The lady said I had to wait until 1PM. I told her absolutely not. I want a refund which I think I got maybe 75% back of the ticket going back. But what a horrible way to end a trip. It is so foreign to me that as a consumer we have to notify the airlines of a cancellation within 24 hours of purchase of our ticket for a full refund. If anytime after that we don’t get a full refund. But the airlines can screw over so many people and ruin so many trips with out notice of delaying or canceling the plane. I will never ever fly American Airlines again. I only flew them this time because Southwest didn’t fly to Canada. I always fly Southwest and never have any issues with them. American Airlines are snakes and fraudulent. They will do anything to keep themselves ahead and don’t care at all about the passengers.

Flight cancellation after cancellation lead to us being left on the tarmac in San Antonio for hours. We were then taken off the plane to clear customs and abandoned in San Antonio. No communication attempts were made except emails saying I had been rescheduled on flights, moved to a lower class of service and then those were cancelled as well. I was willing to take my chances that Houston would be a better bet given weather and we had to rent a car to get us to Houston to attempt to get home to SFO in a reasonable amount of time.

As many people know, American had some serious software blackout issues that delayed and cancelled an untold number of flights on June 17 - the day I happened to be flying. I had saved my airline miles to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip with my two young daughters. I spent 240,000 airline miles, only to have my flights delayed (and later found out they were cancelled). We had guided tours booked in Anchorage, and delays meant cancelled trip, lost money, no memories. We had been planning this trip for the last two years, so out of desperation, I stayed on the phone with American until I was able to book a flight out of Charlotte, a two hour drive away. We threw the luggage in the car and rushed to make it in time. We eventually made our final destination, but not with our luggage - it was lost. Without going into too many details, it was late at night the following day before I got my luggage, and only because I physically went back to the airport, demanded to look in their baggage claim, then demanded to do a physical search of the Alaskan Airlines baggage area. No one could find my bag in their computer, but I found it stuffed in the back of Alaska Airlines. If I had not taken all of these extreme measures our trip would be a total loss. The flight itself was ok. No food offered without extra fees. The flight attendants only came by once. The seats were very tight and uncomfortable. When I returned I filed a complaint with American, asking for at least some of my miles to be refunded. They offered a whopping 682 miles for my trouble. 682 miles out of 240,000!! I was appalled. I literally could not believe such a slap in the face. I appealed my complaint to corporate, and received a scripted answer letting me know that they stood by their decision and reassured me it was more than fair.

We were supposed to have a 1.5 hour layover. Our flight from Boston to Chicago was delayed by an hour due to weather. No problem, these things happen. Usually when flights are delayed by that much the airline makes a special attempt to help travelers who need to make connections. But as we approached landing in Chicago they made no mention of connecting flights. They did not ask if anyone needed to rush off the plane to make a flight. They did not announce whether there were gate changes for connecting flights. I was at the back of the plane. Others I were traveling with were further up front. They ran ahead to the gate, which was in another wing of the terminal, a 10 minute walk, 6 minute run. I followed as soon as I got off the plane. Of course the gate was changed but no one at the old gate, when I finally got there, knew where the new gate was, so that took 3 minutes to locate it. My traveling companions who got to the correct gate first told the gate attendants that I was right behind them. But still they closed the jetway door seconds before I arrived and refused to open it. They had nothing to say, just pointed me to the customer service desk. The flights themselves were fine, comfortable, but the lack of customer focus, common courtesy, and most importantly the lack of helpful service on the delayed flight is emblematic of a company that just doesn't care. No attempt was made to help avoid the problem to begin with by asking if anyone had to rush due to the delay. No calls were made to the connecting gate to tell them that passengers were on their way. No attempt was made to help at the gate. And no apology was given at the service desk. It was a full team effort across numerous American employees to demonstrate that they couldn't care less about me as a customer. Pathetic. Also, JetBlue and Virgin both have free Wifi.

I politely waved at an attendant as she passed for the cabin and asked for another drink, and her response was very unenthusiastic. She returned 5 mins later and I thanked her, her response was shark ""OK"" and she disappeared. A seat mate pressed the call button as he needed water, and was scolded by one of the attendant, so for the rest of the flight I was too scared to ask for anything.

I'm 198cm tall (6'6""), and usually when I fly other airlines between Japan and the U.S., I can get some extra legroom at no cost --= either by asking for a bulkhead seat or an exit row. American, however, charges extra for these options. (Seriously!? I'm supposed to pay for the privilege of assisting other passengers in the event of an emergency?!) Other (non-U.S.) airlines consider this a matter of customer service. When the ground attendants see me, they usually understand my need. Moreover, the legroom in a normal economy seat on this flight was horrendous. I actually had way more legroom in a regular economy seat on my flight a few days later with Southwest between Los Angeles and Denver. That's right -- a low-cost carrier offered considerably more legroom on a 2.5-hour flight on a Boeing 737 than American did on a 10-hour flight on a Boeing 787. On top of this, I didn't see any of the flight attendants smile during the whole flight. They weren't actively unfriendly, but they barely even acknowledged passengers with eye contact. I tried to be a model passenger and say ""please"" and ""thank you"" when ordering and receiving drinks and food, but crew members didn't even acknowledge this with a ""You're welcome"" or a smile. Also, the food was decidedly substandard. A few things were good about the flight: The tickets were cheap, the flight was on time, and the entertainment system and options were good. Also, on my return flight the staff were a bit more friendly. These are the reasons I'm rating it a 4. This is why I always try to avoid US. carriers.

I booked tickets in March 2018 for a trip from Phoenix to DCA in June 2018. We were assigned seats in row 16 on the outbound flight and row 17 on the return flight. I happened to call the airline one week before the flight to ask a question about baggage fees. I was told that the seats had been changed and we were in row 33 on the outbound flight and row 32 on the return flight. The representative was of no help. I was also told that we had been assigned a new flight that was leaving and returning at a different time than the original flight. We were never told of the flight or seat changes and had I called in to ask about the baggage fees we would not have known until we checked in. After several calls I was told that I could “upgrade” my current seats to essentially the same seats I had originally booked for $300 extra. I paid the extra fees because I did not want to sit in the back of the plane. After several more phone calls I was told that they would look into giving me a credit for extra $300. They finally did give me credit for the additional $300 that I paid. That’s all they did. No apology. Nothing. This airline does not care about customer experience. In contrast, my wife and I had a Southwest flight that was just delayed two hours in leaving phoenix to San Francisco. Southwest gave us each a voucher for $100 for the inconvenience. It is hard to believe that an airline such as American does not value it’s customers.

Unremarkable or even bad service is frankly the norm on pretty much every airline in the US, with certain well-known exceptions. To expect anything else is setting yourself up for disappointment, as reflected by the majority of reviews for this airline. Yes, I too have experienced the dreaded day-long weather delay, but I still fly American because they handled the situation as well as could be expected and they don't control the weather. I flew from New York to Sydney with layovers in Charlotte and Los Angeles. My domestic short-haul flights were unremarkable. I had a tight connection in Charlotte (40 minutes) which I made with no problem thanks to helpful ground staff. Both flights were on older 737s without seatback or BYOD IFE. On the flight from JFK to CLT this was fine, but the 5 hour flight from CLT to LAX would have been unpleasant had I not had my own stuff on hand. Legroom on both flights was more than adequate. I am 6 feet tall, somewhat overweight, and had no issues with personal space. American's hard product is easily my personal favorite of the big three, even on older aircraft. Beverage service was brusque and impersonal, as is the norm, but flight attendants were very good in a one-on-one setting. There were frequent advertisements for AA-branded credit cards on both flights, taking the form of promotional videos and several in-flight announcements from flight attendants. Some announcements alluded to cardholder benefits not actually provided by the card, so be wary of that should you find the offer enticing, but I believe this was more a misunderstanding of the product by the FAs than a willful attempt to deceive. All in all, American's domestic service is perfectly reasonable, provided you have realistic expectations of what an airline is and isn't capable of doing. American's long haul international service greatly exceeded my admittedly minimal expectations. My flight from LAX to Sydney, clocking in at a whopping 15 hours, was a brand new 787-900 with a 3-3-3 layout in economy, a definite improvement over the 3-4-3 layout found on most American long haul metal. The seat provided ample legroom and storage space. Carry-on bins were large and easily accessible. IFE was provided by a large, high definition seatback screen. The selection was enormous, but leaned much more heavily to films over TV. The in-flight map is better than most US carriers. The interface for the IFE is somewhat frustrating at first. The default layout requires frequent swiping and dragging, which the touch screen is not very good at. This can be fixed by switching to a grid based display system, which I did not discover was an option until we were close to landing. There was also a catalogue of music and books available though the system, but the selection was not very good. Dinner and breakfast were served to all passengers on this flight. Meals were surprisingly good, being flavorful and well-portioned in both instances. I enjoyed about 7 hours of rest on this flight, which is much better than the 2 or 3 I generally manage to hobble together flying to Europe. The 787 is a wonderful aircraft, and is easily my first choice when flying overseas. All in all, my round trip flight from New York to Sydney cost $1400 per person, an excellent value.

We immediately went to speak to an American Airlines representative, who told us that they were likely not going to be able to get us into Kansas City that evening. What they could do is get us into Phoenix, to which they could put us up in a hotel for the night, and we could fly out the next day (the 13th). Seeing this was only realistic option we had we agreed to stay in Phoenix for the night. As we waited on the flight to arrive from its delay, once we got on the plane, the flight was then again delayed, this time due to weather in Phoenix. After about 20 minutes the flight was then cancelled. We got in line to talk with another American Airlines representative to see what we would need to do for a hotel reservation to stay in Sacramento for the night, as we clearly were not getting into Phoenix. We were then told that they were not responsible for hotel accommodations due to inclement weather. Had we known that the flight to Phoenix was going to have weather trouble we would have taken the flight into Charlotte, or we could have looked at another Airline flight. I asked if I could speak to a manager and the representative told me I would need to go online to file a complaint.. The Customer Service Representative wouldn't even sit us together on our flights for the next day. We were assigned separated seats and when we asked if we could sit together, we were told that we would have to pay a premium for upgraded seats (There were multiple open seats at that time, many of which were not first class). All and all we spent about 7 hours in the airport that day We both ended up having to take an additional day of work We had to pay someone to watch our animals for an additional day We had to pay for a hotel in Sacramento We had to pay for dinner, breakfast, and lunch before we got to fly out the next day (8/13) We had to pay for transportation to the hotel from the airport And we had to pay for an additional day of parking in Kansas City On top of all of this. I have had to call and plead my case (three separate calls) to American Airlines ""Customer Service"" for over two hours on the phone. I have spoken to three different “Customer Service Reps” and 2 different managers. After a week of not hearing from American Airlines I decided to call back. This time I was told that they could not find the complaint that had been filed by Lou and that if I had a formal complaint I would need to file it with the online form (https://www.aa.com/contact/forms?topic=CR#/).

My flight with another airline was cancelled last minute due to weather; so, I booked a one-way ticket with AA for the following day using the miles I had been saving for years and paid the $75 fee to do so. After waiting on the runway for almost 3 hours, we were told we had to return to the gate to refuel; however, once at the gate, we were finally told that the flight was cancelled and passengers were told to deplane and figure it out with the gate agent. The next flight AA could get me on was the following day at 6pm, so I waited in line for 3 more hours to obtain a travel voucher for one night stay (would you want your wife or daughter sleeping alone in LaGuardia Airport?) But to my surprise, I was told by the AA gate agent, who was seemingly extremely exhausted and overwhelmed, that AA no longer issued travel vouchers and that would have to instead submit a post-flight reimbursement claim at AA.com/customerrelations, including all receipts for hotel, food and transportation. As you can already guess, my request was denied, stating that it is not AA's 'approach to offer compensation for ATC delays', plus a bunch of other highly-pacifist lip service. My frustration and reason for this review is not due to my time being wasted on a runway for 3 hours or even for the flight being cancelled. My frustration is due to the fact that an AA employee lied directly to my face about AA no longer issuing travel vouchers (since apparently they do still offer voucher for cancelled flights) knowing damn-well I would not be reimbursed. So, on top of the miles and fee I paid to use those miles that I'd already spent thousands of dollars on to obtain, I'm out an additional $470 bc their employee lied to me.

I have worked in a call center before, and I know how aggravating it can be to be someones personal punching bag. However, once on the line with this agent, my complaint changed from one of unfortunate circumstance to one of complete disbelief that American Airlines can be so callous towards customers.

She pronounced my name with blatant disgust and ensured to pronounce hers with an air of authority that indicated I should feel graced by the fact that she took a few minutes out of her important schedule to speak to me. She belittled my concerns, refused to offer any recourse whatsoever, or apologies for inconveniences, and basically openly insulted me when I implied that the airline with the flight I was trying to get on was American Airlines, as opposed to being an opposing airlines flight. When I called her out on this by asking her if she found it acceptable to speak to me with a condescending and patronizing tone of voice was to talk over me, loudly telling me that she was not doing that, and then to proceed to disconnect my phone call in the middle of my sentence. I called back, and requested to speak to a supervisor in regards to my experience with a customer service rep. She patched me through to a representative in the same position, that informed me that she doesn't know who she is, and I can't file a complaint through her or speak to anyone who can record a complaint against her, as they are an email only department. After about 15 minutes of going around in circles with her, I wrote out a detailed email to the department I was told to reach out to, and received a cookie cutter type response offering insincere apologies and offering no recourse whatsoever. The agent and my experience with American Airlines has left me in complete disbelief that a company can operate with such indecent practices, and offer no remorse whatsoever or even a token apology to make the situation a little more bearable. I understand that some things, especially weather, are out of a companies control, but the callous disregard they have for the inconvenience that their customers are put through as well as the disrespectful way that their customer service handles the situation are completely unacceptable.

We asked to check in one of the children’s cabin baggage and were instructed that this would cost a further $100 as 7 albeit light bags had been checked in.

Due to the devestation of Hurricane Maria we cancelled our flight and were told we had a year to reuse our tickets. I tried to make my new reservation on Aug. 10, 2018 and was declined to use my credit because the credit was only valid until year from the date of purchase which was Aug. 7, 2017 and not from the ticketed departure date of Dec. 12, 2017.

Needless to say I was very upset and made a formal request begging for a 3 day extension in order to uae my almost $2,100 credit and this is the message I just received 3 days after my request. I'm sorry that you didn't travel with us as planned nor were you able to use the value of your unused tickets within a year. We know that travel doesn't always happen as planned, which is why we give our customers one year from the date the original ticket was issued to begin new travel. We believe that offering a full year to rebook travel provides our customers the flexibility they need to use their flight credit. I'm sorry for any disappointment we might cause by declining your request. Let me assure you that our position does not lessen our regard for you as our customer. It is always our pleasure to serve you, and I hope that we have the opportunity to welcome you aboard again soon. This is the same as stealing!!!

Each FA wore a different uniform, except for the younger staff, who represented the airline with proper etiquette. Tie, no tie, blue shirt, white shirt, grey jersey dress, etc., it was was mix-match that sent an unprofessional message. Sadly the warmth and service suffered from the same issue. The FA in Business Class functioned. There was no extra sense that I was flying in a ""Flagship"" experience. Nothing was offered other than the typical drink, dinner and snack. No walk-through the cabins to offer additional aperitifs or any other needs or niceties. The much boasted wine-pairing was not even mentioned.

Taken back once again by the courteous and helpful nature of the now management I said ""would you like to wait to chat with me until you have more time?"" She then peered at me with a cold glare and asked me to continue. I explained the attitude I encountered at the front counter she showed no element of caring and proceeded to tell me if I'm not 1.5 hours early there is no guarantee the staff at AA will do their job and get you on the flight. Other passengers were pervy to my conversation and began to share their stories of rude counter staff here today too.

The air hostesses were arrogant and would not like to entertain simple questions like “hey do have some fruits for the kids?” I specifically asked for the name to complain and she would not divulge her name. A simple yes or know would have sufficed but all I get is ""Why are you bothering me"" look. This kind of behavior deters families traveling with American and could cost in the long run.

I was flying unaccompanied with a toddler on this trip. I intentionally booked flights that had a couple layovers thinking it would give the baby the opportunity to get out and about to do something else on a long journey. These layovers is where all the trouble started. Flew from Denver to North Carolina and made the connection without a hitch. Then from North Carolina to Orlando before heading to London. My flight coming into Orlando arrived late. By the time I was able to de-board the plane my connection was boarding in another terminal, completely on the other side of the airport where I had to leave and re-enter security to get there. Since I was carrying a 30+ lb. Toddler and a 15+ lb carseat I tried to ask for help to get where I needed to go quickly. The gate agents response (at every stop) was it's faster just to do it yourself.  So nowI sprint across all of the Orlando airport get to security only to find the boarding passes they sent me for my British Airways connection don't work. Security tells me I have to go to the ticket counter to get new passes .my flight is boarding as we speak. I run to the ticket counter, loaded down with baby & her stuff to find no one at the counter. Talk to the American Airlines representative (flight is booked as american airlines, operated as british airways) to be informed they can't do anything they will have to see if there is someone around for British Airways. Find someone, get my boarding pass, make it through security get on the plane with 3 minutes to spare. Coming back was worse. Flight out of Florida was delayed 2 hours causing me to miss my connection. After flying 9 hours with a toddler, going through customs in and out of security and hauling around all the baby gear they wanted to put me on a connecting flight to get home the following moring! Finally found 1 gate agent who sympathized and managed to get me the last 2 seats on the last flight that night. However; when arriving for my connection in Dallas they changed the arrival gate to another terminal completely across the airport. Once again the connection was boarding, asked gate agents for help to get across the airport quickly and was told it was faster to do it myself. RAN with toddler and accessories across all of DFW. As a mother of 3, two who are now grown I remember gate agents and airport staff being much more helpful with families flying with young children. Apparently preboarding for parents flying with young children doesn't exist to this airline anymore. When I asked the rep almost laughed at me. It only makes sense so that parents can get kids settled and out of the way of other boarding passengers. Instead I got to stand in the isle, hold up traffic flow and apologize repeatedly to everyone around me while I tried to get the baby in.

","""professional, pleasant and fun crew""",W Nelson,United States,3rd July 2018,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified | Rome to Detroit via Philadelphia. I’ve had my share of bad travel experiences and it’s often I compelled me to write nasty reviews, so it’s only fair that when I have a really great experience I write a fitting review as well. Classic situation- our flight from Rome to Philadelphia (AA 719) was delayed for about two hours, which caused us to miss our connecting flight (with Dreaded Delta) from Philadelphia to our home in Detroit . Very rarely does this pan out in the travelers favor. Great customer service isn’t born by perfection; not every flight is on time, and mistakes are made. Great customer service is all about making it right. Like all travelers in this situation, I just wanted to get home and that’s exactly what happened. American ended up booking us on a full flight about an hour after our original flight into Detroit, causing minimal inconvenience. Free of charge. Technically speaking I think AA had no obligation to do this and that Delta, if anyone, would have issued us new tickets (and no, we did not have insurance). Beyond that, I have to say that the staff of flight AA 719 was the most professional, pleasant and fun crew I have been around over probably a hundred flights. Both the staff on the flight and the representatives I spoke to on the phone (especially supervisor Leslie) were extremely helpful and understanding of our situation. They had rules and protocol and they broke them to help us — they treated us like individuals and not like numbers. That is the hallmark of a class organization. Generally speaking, when I select flights I’m looking more for price and timing. In the future I’m going to lean towards American Airlines. We could very easily have missed our flight, bought new tickets, hotel accommodations, a last second extra day off work, etc — that happens to people every day. I am genuinely appreciative of American Airlines effort to spare us.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Detroit via Philadelphia,July 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,Recommendedyes

Then later that afternoon I was scheduled to leave Greensboro on a direct flight to Philadelphia and returning to Tampa the following day). Stand at curbside for ten minutes or so waiting for “computer problems” to be resolved so I can check my one bag. Finally gave up and went inside. Stood in that line for I guess another fifteen minutes or so because by the time it was my turn I was one minute ... yes, one minute inside the 45 minute cutoff to check a bag. What ensued over the next ten or fifteen minutes is not even worth going into, but suffice it to say that due to the ineptitude and uncaring of this “customer service representative” and his even more inept and uncaring supervisor, I missed a domestic flight I arrived an hour and fifteen minutes early for and was put on standby for the next one which was going to get me in an hour later than my first meeting was scheduled to start. While waiting on standby at the gate, I happened to start chatting with a girl sitting next to me, and turns out she is an AA employee’s daughter, and tells me somewhat sheepishly that it is AA policy to overbook every flight by at least five seats and their workaround is that any preferred status members who want on a flight can get on because they will work the system to get idiots like me who had the audacity to want to check a piece of luggage to “miss” their flight by milking the clock and then invoking FAA regulations. By some miracle, I did get on the standby flight, made it to Charlotte and on to Greensboro and went to baggage claim to get my bag. Guess what? No bag. A patently disinterested, gum-popping employee in the baggage office told me that my bag had been checked on to Philadelphia because “this isn’t where you are actually going.” Oh no? Then why am I here now? Too much in a hurry to worry about it, I left to get to what was left of my meetings and returned to the airport in Greensboro.

This woman, who was actually nice enough, unlike everyone else I had dealt with so far, proceeded to tell me in about 0.2 seconds that yes, in fact, my bag was already in Philadelphia. The amazing part was that she hadn’t looked at my baggage claim ticket or touched her computer so I guess she was a psychic?

We started the boarding process where group 1 was starting to board. Then an announcement was made that there was a flat tire on the plane and they needed an hour to replace the tire. Half hour later we had a weather delay, no big deal its weather not their fault. After the weather cleared the work on the tire never started and another announcement was made that they needed an hour to fix the tire.

First and foremost when I booked my flight, I booked it so I would leave out of my home city Sarasota/Bradenton. I was to leave at 5:00 on a Friday morning. At 10:30 p.m. on Thursday I get a text that my flight has been cancelled. Of course I immediately call AA and am told it will take one and half to two hours before I even get a return call. I wait for about an hour and try again. Rather than giving me the call back option this time, they recognize my number and ask me to hold. I do so for about 45 minutes. Eventually I get a customer service representative and my only option is to fly out of Tampa airport the next morning. They initially had me rebooked on a 10:30 a.m. Flight from Tampa but by the time I got into Nashville and then drove two hours to where my daughter lives, all of Friday would have been wasted. So I rebooked on a 5:00 a.m. Flight, getting into Nashville at the same time I would have if my Sarasota flight hadn't been cancelled. By this time it's 1:00 or so in the morning. That leaves me about an hour's worth of sleeping time before I have to get up and leave for the Tampa airport. While I made the flight on time and the customer service representative was very helpful in getting me on that flight, the fact remains I had to drive an hour to the airport and park my car whereas if I had left from Sarasota like I normally do, I would have used Uber and not incurred $90 in parking fees (plus two hours of driving time and tolls). American Airlines refuses to reimburse me. If I had missed my flight you can be sure I wouldn't have gotten a refund or any other courtesy. All I want is a refund of the parking fees.

On the outbound they kept announcing another 30 minute delay(mechanical problem in the interior) every half hour for a total 3 hour delay. The ground crew was heard saying they did not have enough maintenance people working on a Sunday afternoon. The dinner service once onboard was rushed and unpleasant and I chalked it up to the late take off. Not so, because the service from the flight attendants on the return trip was just as shabby. FA were unfriendly, unhelpful, and at times rude or condescending towards passengers. They acted as if they did not want to be there doing this job.  I was in the new Premium Economy cabin and paid a lot more than an economy fare for my ticket. I feel the higher cost should include better service, not just a bigger seat. The new Premium Economy passengers had to go sometimes to the very back of the plane and through the galley to use a vacant lavatory. Forget stretching your legs on a long flight by walking to the back as the aisles are so narrow in the Main Cabin one can not avoid bumping seated passengers.There was no offer of refills on the free alcohol drinks.

",Sumeet Singla,United States,13th June 2018,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified | They don’t really care about customer relations. I have seen several times that they overbook the flights when seriously, with advent of technology, it can clearly be avoided. They don’t even have enough staff at airports to run things smoothly. Let me tell you what I went through: 1) First my flight from Cedar Rapids to Chicago was delayed by 3 hours. You know how far Chicago is from Cedar Rapids? Just 30 minutes if we go by air. This has happened to me twice. You know airlines from other countries are carrying passengers on their transatlantic flights without delays, cancellations and excellent customer service. Its about time they visit those countries and take a lesson on how to provide a valuable customer service. 2) Then, they let everyone board the plane but somehow manage to find an excuse to not take off. We had to wait for take-off on tarmac for 2 hours and on top of that, the pilot doesn’t even announce periodically what is going on. This was agonizing for so many passengers. I purposely selected this flight because I had a 3 hour layover in Chicago and I was going to meet my friend, but because of delays caused by American Airlines, I will have to wait for another couple of months. Don’t even tell me it was a weather related delay as it was sunny! They clearly either didn’t have pilots or planes to provide the service and yet, booked us knowing very well that their services were not adequate in any way. I reached Chicago Airport at 5.30 pm when I was supposed to arrive there around 2.30 pm. But this was just the beginning. 3) Then while waiting for my next plane out of Chicago to Newark, they very cleverly increased the delay by 15-20 minutes at one time so that customers don’t cancel with them and fly with any other airlines because when you incrementally delay flights by 15 minutes, customers are more likely to stay with that particular airline in order to reach their destination. Whereas, if you had displayed from the beginning that it was 2-3 hours delay, customers were more likely to look for other options to reach their destination. 4) Then we boarded the plane at 8.30 pm, 2.5 hours after scheduled time and the same thing happened. We were on the runway for the next 2.5 hours. 2.5 hours! For what? No one knows. Crew failed to provide any update. There was no weather delays again. After 2.5 hours, the pilot turned the plane back to gate telling that he has completed his hours and couldn’t fly. Tell me about commitment levels displayed by American Airlines. Clearly, there is nothing American about your airlines anymore. 5) Then, I was told bags will arrive at carousel 6 and they arrived at carousel 7 instead. Ground staff in baggage claim area didn’t even have a clue that my flight was cancelled. When I asked about where was my bag, I gave him my bag ticket and he was said “what was texture of your bag, what color was your bag”? What sort of ridiculous questions were they? 7) Now, I had to skip my whole day at work.

Sleeping at CLT: How a flight crew laid waste our $4105.29 AA Vacation family weekend in New York. First, when I wrote my review of our AA Vacations Westin La Paloma trip in April, I didn't think that experience could be worsted (opposite of bested), so I didn't expect to be writing about another superlatively bad AA Vacation again, at least not so soon. I was wrong. The moral of this story is if you value the welfare of your family, your time and your money, don't rely on AA Vacations. But I've gotten ahead of myself. Here's our story. Things went beautifully on the first leg of what was to have been a fun family weekend in NY to celebrate the end of our son's school year. We sped through TSA pre, were greeted courteously at the gate and took our assigned seats in first class on AA1937. After a pleasant short flight to Charlotte, we connected to AA1981 bound for LaGuardia. When that flight didn't push away on time, the captain announced from the flight deck that a ""minor technical issue"" would hold us up briefly. I followed a running text stream of delay notices from AA on my phone. Then I received the dreaded notice of cancellation. Oddly, the flight crew were still telling us that the “technical issue” was in the process of being fixed. Specifically, the pilot advised that the copilot had flown too many hours to legally make the trip to NY and AA was on the hunt for a replacement. When I told the cabin attendant that the flight had been cancelled, she passed the news to the captain who, nonplussed, announced that ""apparently American Airlines notifies passengers of cancellations before telling its crew."" We were advised to deplane and come back at 7:00 a.m. the following day. I immediately called AA Vacations who had booked as part of our package non-refundable tickets for activities and events on Saturday. I got a terrific agent named Kristen who nimbly booked us on a flight to Newark. She even kept our first-class status! All we had to do was run the mile from the end of terminal C to the end of terminal B before the flight's scheduled 10:00 departure. We needn't have run. The flight to Newark was delayed due to a mechanical. First 11:00, then 12:00, then vouchers to Starbucks, then 1:00, then first class boarded, then we were told to deplane, then 2:00; and then it was cancelled. The gate agent, a terrific woman with a superman pin affixed to her purse, explained sincerely sympathetically that because NASCAR was in town there were no hotel rooms left in Charlotte. Like Tom Hanks in The Terminal we were to live in the airport for the night. No options. We dragged ourselves back to gate C19, the assigned departure gate for AA9200, boarding at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday. We were heartened to see an airplane already parked there. With nothing to eat, no place to sleep and no cardboard boxes, we were all newly sympathetic to street people. We put as cheerful a face on the five hour night as we could. When boarding time came, we didn't board. The plane that had been sitting at gate C19, on which we had hung the night's hopes was ""the wrong size."" Yes, the gate agent said he had been given an airplane ""the wrong size"" for the number of passengers booked. I could feel the crowd of passengers working itself into a mob. Since most like us had been bumped from the CLT/LGA and CLT/EWR flights the night before, I could well sympathize.",Family Leisure,Business Class,Jacksonville to New York via Charlotte,May 2018,4.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,,1,Recommendedno

In Sept. 17, I received an email that AA changed our reservations. It seemed fine since it was a shorter travel time than the original tickets. The a.m. of the flight we arrived to check in at PDX, and during the self-check in, we got a priority slip. We took it to the ticket counter and learned that when AA changed our flights, they did not allow their own “mandatory” 50 minutes for the connection flight. As such, they refused to allow us to catch our connection from DFW to CZM. Keep in mind that this was their mandatory layover time and they made the change that didn’t conform to it! AA was unable to locate a flight that would get us into Cozumel the same day, so we were forced to incur an overnight layover at DFW. To add insult to injury, each leg of each flight they were challenged to allow me and my fiancé sit together. We would have to pay at the ticket gate to move seats. Um, we purchased our tickets at the same time, is it too far of a stretch to consider we might want to sit together! So, for four flights we had to take extra time to “sweet talk” the gate agent into letting us sit together. Unbelievable! Due to the layover resulting from AA’s error, we were forced to incur additional hotel and meal costs, spend time rearranging transfers, contacting the hotel, etc., lost an entire day of vacation time/pay, lost our all-inclusive charges and hotel charge from the hotel in Cozumel, stressed out having to pick up the pieces because of AA’s mistake, and now I’m getting the pleasure of fighting with AA since they are only offering is a $250 flight voucher for each of us. That doesn’t come close to compensating for the time, money, and trouble they caused. And actually, at this point, I wish I were fighting with them. They’ve gone incommunicado. Won’t call when they say they will, won’t return calls. and, who would want vouchers from this joke of an airline? The only silver lining was the accommodating flight attendants.

Normally I don’t have problems with AA but after a recent flight cancellation for the second part of my journey, I am very disappointed with the lack of action on AA’s part. My flight which was on a Sunday night was delayed for about 1.5-2 hours at which point it was canceled due to “maintenance issues.” I called AA to reschedule a flight and also went to the customer service desk. I had a flight for work the following morning at 10:30 so I really need to get back. I asked if I could be put on another flight, switched airlines, flown out somewhere else and come from another place, get a rental car, or anything that would allow me to make my flight the next morning. They said there is nothing I can do but I can go online and get a reimbursement which should be up to $120. I ended up having to rent a car and drive from DFW to OKC which cost me about $260. I have tried to be reimbursed for this cost but the best I got was a $100 voucher that has to be used within a year. The problem is very few flights cost $100 so this forces me to fly AA again within the year and have to pay them more out of my pocket so this is in no way a reimbursement but a way for them to secure my future business.

I was traveling from Myrtle Beach to Detroit with my wife and 8-month old daughter. Our original flight plan involved a 1-hour layover in DC. After boarding in Myrtle Beach we were instructed there was a weather delay and we were taken off the plane. After waiting 45+ minutes in line at the gate, and being refused help from the neighboring American Airlines gate, we were rebooked for a 1-hour layover in Charlotte. When that flight was also delayed I expressed concern at the gate because we may not make the connector in Charlotte. The employee was disinterested in helping us find a backup plan in case this occurred. When we arrived in Charlotte we had no chance of making the connector. The employee in Myrtle Beach knew full well that we would not make this connector but sent us onto the plane anyway. After waiting 90+ minutes to speak to customer service in Charlotte we were rebooked to travel to Chicago, then to Toledo. We ran through the airport in order to make the flight to Chicago, but later found out that our checked luggage was left in Charlotte. 4 planes in 4 separate airports before we arrived home (with our 8-month old daughter!) at 12:30a.

Instead we were forced to rebook another flight. Communication wasn't great at this point. We thought we were getting rebooked for another route that would get us home only an hour after our original flight, and one flight, as we had originally booked. But we were handed two tickets (rather than the one) on a flight that didn't depart till the next day.

I'm writing this in hopes someone that gets paid too much at American Airlines finally makes some changes to improve how they operate. I was the typical customer making a connection that was predetermined by the airline. Using decades of history and algorithms to maximize efficiency for the company and yet getting customer where they need to be you would think this would not be an issue anymore. We got off one plane and literally ran across the airport getting to our terminal 10 minutes before it was scheduled to leave at which they told us ""we knew you were checked in and coming but we can't let you in 10 minutes before flight"". At that time we gave them a confused look as it was 10 minutes before the flight. So you see where I am going with this and why I will never fly with them again but the story gets better from there. We go down to customer service as instructed by the gate attendant to see if we can get on the next flight that is 3 hours delay which sounds good at first but not when you have family waiting for you that drove over 4 hours to pick you up. We had asked if they could do anything from free tickets to a cup of coffee of which they denied saying this happens all the time and it is not our fault. And now for the icing on the cake, they were not sure where our luggage was and after 5 minutes they said it made it on to our original flight. Crazy how that works out right? Now after if spins around the turn style for 45 minutes and hopefully nobody takes it they said it will be picked up and then placed in an office for us to pick up.

My flight from Colorado Springs to Shreveport was weather delayed in Colorado Springs. I understand that these things happen. But when arriving in Dallas to switch connections to go to Shreveport, I rushed to my gate and found that my plane was still at the gate. But they would not allow me to board. The flight departed earlier than scheduled with me watching it leave the gate without me. I was very disappointed that American did not notify the gate that a passenger was a few minutes late due to their late arrival of a connecting flight. It is not like it was an hour or more, it was 10 minutes at most. Other airlines that I have flown have notified other gates of this happening, especially if it is weather related. I am a frequent flier on many airlines, and it has been done for me before. Due to this, I was under a lot of stress. My main reason for going to Shreveport was to meet my daughter and get her back home to Florida. I went to flight services in Dallas, and they were not any help at all. No monetary help or voucher for a hotel overnight either. They attempted to help me with getting my checked bag that arrived with me in Dallas, but the employee from my arriving gate had already gone home because it was after 9. Because of this, my bag left the next morning to go to Shreveport, even though I was going to be leaving from Dallas later in the day to go back to Florida with my daughter, who was arriving from Shreveport. To make things worse, I had to wait 6 days to get my suitcase returned to me in Florida. After checking with American baggage services, I found out that it stayed in Shreveport for 5 days sitting there. My bag had important business materials inside. Needless to say, unless it is a last resort, I will not be flying American Airlines again.

I was returning to Houston from Salt Lake City, I had to go thru Dallas for a connecting flight. My flight in Salt Lake City was delayed due to weather issues originally. I knew I was going to miss my connecting flight in Dallas, once I heard of the delay and got up in line (a long one at that) to be told to call the 1-800 number to get done faster. When I spoke with customer service, they told me ""I'll be fine as the plane is supposed to board at 4.08 pm"" and I was like ""Oh great, ok, I don't need anything else then"". Not realizing the time when I hung up the phone, it was 4.12 pm and there was no plane at the gate. So, we (as in other passengers and myself) were getting updates saying we were boarding every 10 minutes. Come to find out, because of the weather, the plane that was trying to land was re-routed to Pocatello, ID because they needed to re-fuel. The plane finally landed around 6.15 pm, only to learn that our flight was now cancelled due to the fact that the flight crew had met their hours for the day and couldn't fly anymore. So, at that point we were all stranded, most other flights were full and I for sure was going to miss my connecting flight. Supposedly, because this was a weather issue, American Airlines would not put any of the passengers up in hotels, etc. However, it was no longer a weather issue as other planes were flying in and taking off just fine in Salt Lake City. This was clearly, American Airlines crew that couldn't fly anymore. So our flight was delayed until 7.00 am the next morning. So we return to the airport, did not receive any updates on our flight and hoping for the best I spoke with the gentleman at the gate and asked him to help me find a connecting flight to Houston. He told me, they were all full and to try once I get to Dallas to get on stand by. I finally make it to Dallas, I get off the plane and go directly to the ticket counter at the gate that I just walked out of. I explained that I needed a connecting flight to Houston. At first, the lady couldn't find me in the system (even though I just walked off the plane) and then once she did find me in the system, she said she had record of me landing the night before in Dallas. At this point, I was boiling mad, because clearly she just saw me walk off the plane. Then she said, there was a flight later in the evening that she could get me on. I explained it was my daughter's graduation party that evening and I needed to be home before 8.00 pm that night. So, she handed me a boarding pass and told me to go try and get on Stand by on another flight. Went to that gate only to find out there was a lot of other people standing by and probably would not make that flight and at that point I went and got a rental car so I can be home in time for my daughter's graduation party, that I was hosting. My biggest disappoint in the airline is that not one American Airlines employee even said ""I'm sorry!"" When you work in customer service and have an upset customer, you should always acknowledge that you understand the frustration and you are working hard to get us home or to resolve the issue.

I like the fact that AA flies in Frankfurt from the much quieter terminal 2. We were recevied by very friendly groundstaff and had our bag dropped within 15 mins. AA holds firmly to the boarding-by-group system which I like very much. The flight from Frankfurt to Charlotte was good: a rather tasty meal and plenty of drinks and snacks. We only had 1,5 hour connection time to Nashville, so we were a bit weary about that, because you have tot go through immigration and collect your bag again and go through security again, but is was okay. Airport staff is ready tot take your bag immediately from you after immigration so you can rush through security. By the time we got tot the gate boarding began and again we had a very punctual departure for Nashville. Small snack and a drink on this one-hour flight was enough. Checking in in Nashville for our inbound flight again was a breeze. Again very friendly ground staff (we've experienced different before!) and within 10 mins we were at the gate. Flight from Nashville to Philadelphia took only 1,5 hours in stead of the advertised 2 hours and 10 mins and that was good since we had only 50 mins connecting time in Philadelphia. Still quite a run because we arrived at B10 and our plane to Frankfurt was at the furthest gate (A26). By the time we arrived we were almost the last ones to board. Our son wasn't assigned a seat in Nashville but his boarding pass with seat was ready in Philadelphia. Four the fourth time a very punctual departure. Again a meal, rather bland but okay and plenty of drinks and snacks. Breakfast -well, sort of- an hour for landing. 280 films and games to choose from.

We did not have a return flight until Wednesday which meant we had 3 days without any clothing/personal products. I requested some sort of financial compensation because of this and was told that baggage does not handle compensation and to go upstairs and put in a request. When we were upstairs we were told to get into 3 different line ups once we were finally able to speak to someone we were told that they did not provide compensation (I understand about the flight cancellation but believed they should not have sent our suitcases ahead without us). I asked to speak to the supervisor and she told me that they have nothing to do with baggage and if I wanted financial compensation I needed to go back to baggage. She then checked our baggage tags and said our luggage was still in the airport. We then went back downstairs and spoke to someone who was in the luggage area, he was extremely rude so I asked to speak to his supervisor and he refused to call one. His coworker could tell I was becoming visibly upset so called a supervisor. She then left. We waited for approximately 10 minutes and ask the employee who had refused to call a supervisor if they were coming and he said ""no, if you want to speak to a supervisor you need to stand in that line over there"". So we went and stood in line again . Once through the line I asked to speak to the supervisor and told her that we were told upstairs that our suitcases were still in the airport. She said they maybe here but we could not have them and they were going to be forwarded to Toronto.

The staff at the service desk talked more to each other than they did to me, and eventually handed me a scrap of paper with a 1-888 number for Travelassist and told me to go call the number. No empathy, no vouchers for food or shelter to help me along. And when I called the Travelassist number, they told me that all the hotels were booked and to call back in 2 hours to see if anything had come available (which is just as well, because I was so tired I gave up and booked a hotel through Expedia, and later found out that Expedia beat the ""distressed passenger rates"" AA secured by $15 per night!) When I got to the baggage claim to grab the bag I'd checked, it wasn't there, and when I asked the AA rep at the desk about it, he said that it could take 1-2 hours, and ""if my bag didn't show up in 2 hours, come back.""

I was abruptly told by an AA crew member behind me that I had to wait for the gate attendants to show up. When they did, I went up to them to ask if they could help me, and was rudely told by the attendants (whose nametags were completely hidden by their scarves) to come back when they'd finished boarding the current flight.

This is a story about what happens when you are a Platinum Million Miler with American Airlines and you pay full fare for three first-class tickets for your family, booking through AAVacations and one of your family gets bumped by an air marshal. Spoiler alert: To stop you tweeting they mollify you with ""Our AA Vacations team will be able to help out with a refund once your travel is complete."" And once your travel is complete, the AAVacations team tells you they cannot issue refunds and sends you into a bureaucratic maze designed to punish you until you surrender. Here's the back story: First know that there were two marshals sitting in a 9-passenger first-class cabin on the dangerous passage between JAX and DFW. My petite wife ended up taking our displaced son's seat 20A because she was the only one who could fit into it--an unhappy way to start a $7K ""luxury vacation."" 20A is the seat opposite the aft cabin lav on a CR9 RJ900 aircraft. Her seatmate, a small elderly woman who also paid full-fare for a first-class seat, had been displaced by a second air marshal. More, so that the two air marshals could sit silently together, ever vigilant, one played poker and the other solitaire on their phones - my son and I were split up and placed as far apart as possible and still be in the same cabin. Having flown many millions of miles on many carriers, I suspected that not everyone in First had paid full fare for their ticket, so far in advance of boarding we asked the gate agent to look into the possibility of getting us back into our original seats, together three across. Subsequently, she managed to avoid my requests for updates until just before boarding when she advised that ""No one had volunteered to give up their seat"" and attempted to foist a $300 voucher on us as compensation, adding ""There's nothing else I can do."" Not true. When you do finally arrive at your vacation destination, American has managed to lose your bag. Now I understand that this happens, but how did they lose only one of the four bags we checked and why did it have to be my wife's bag?

Flight: 5243 March 23, 2018 from CAK to PHL First, we would like to thank the flight crew for their efforts to make a bad situation better and to resolve the unfortunate miscommunication with flight maintenance. Our understanding of the issue provided by the pilot was that there was some discrepancy with the flight maintenance log and that someone from maintenance would need to review and approve it before we could take off. The plane had been at the gate for over an hour before we boarded, and no maintenance was performed. We were informed that flight maintenance needed 30 minutes to resolve the issue, which turned into an additional 30+ plus minutes. At this point we have missed the original departure schedule but the crew was told it would be resolved in another 30 minutes and we could make up some time due to tail winds. Because of the delay sitting on the tarmac passengers were offered to deplane with the knowledge that they could not board again. Apparently, a passenger that only spoke Russian did deplane not realizing she could not return. She was very upset and in tears when she was allowed back on the plane, which, unfortunately impacted the departure time. At this point we had been on hold for more than two hours and it was clear we would miss our connecting flight from Philadelphia to Birmingham. Since there were no more flights to Birmingham that evening we were provided rooms at the Airport Wyndham hotel, comfortable at this point due to our exhaustion, but nowhere near a three-star hotel as advertised. We didn’t fly Spirit Airlines because of bad reviews, now we have one to tell regarding our experience with American Airlines. The situation seems like it could have been avoided with better communications and if flight maintenance would have done their required repairs before we boarded the flight.

I asked the agent, why the family before us was allowed and why we had to check our stroller in. She stated that it must have been missed.

The issue is in what happened after our flight was canceled. We were rebooked on a flight for the next morning, that would have taken us from NY to Boston, and then to Miami - a total of about 6 hours travel the next day. I called the 800# for AA to talk to someone about rebooking for something, anything that would get us into Miami that day, so we would not have to waste 2 entire days of our 5 day break (while also wasting hotel nights, and other things we'd planned). When I spoke to the person on the 800# she told me that there were no more flights leaving JFK, Newark, or LaGuardia, going to Miami that day. And maybe this was true for direct flights. I asked if there were any other options whatsoever, with flights going elsewhere that might then connect to Miami that day. She told me there were no other options. I asked, point blank, ""So you're telling me that no more flights are arriving in Miami for American Airlines for the rest of the day?"" She told me the only option was for this flight we had been rebooked. I then went to a counter to try to get on a standby list for an AA flight that was full, and going to Miami. Seeing a growing line of upset people, the attendant at the counter actually made an announcement that he could not help anyone who had been booked for the 6.45 canceled flight. I spoke to him anyway. I, again, asked if there were any options at all that would get us to Miami via American. He told me he was just too busy to help me. I'd like you to meditate on this for a moment: an AA service representative told me that he was too busy to help me, a customer whose paid flight on American Airlines for himself and his family to go away for spring break had just been canceled. We went to another AA gate for a later Miami flight to try to get on the standby list. At this gate we spoke to a gentleman. He was very pleasant, added us to the standby list, and then we sat. A few minutes later, he me up to the counter and said he could get us on a flight to Chicago, and from there we could pick up a flight to Miami. I was somewhat incredulous after a) being told that there were no options by the AA ""service"" rep on the phone, and b) being told that by another AA ""service"" rep that he was ""too busy"" to help me. So I asked him to confirm that we would have guaranteed seats to Chicago, and then to Miami. He said yes, and that we'd get in around 9pm. It worked-we made it to Chicago, then Miami, and ultimately only lost 1 day, arriving at our hotel in Miami almost exactly 12 hours late. But we did not lose a hotel night, and we did not have to reschedule anything else. This man saved our vacation. The rest of the AA staff and system is rigid, inflexible, and robotic, and do not try to help customers. They seem perfectly okay with unhappy, sad, disappointed and angry customers. Maybe they see it all the time and are numb to it. Maybe they need better training, maybe they take too much garbage from some customers who no doubt act like jerks.

I had to purchase a separate ticket with American to get to and from my final destination paired with a mileage ticket on JAL. Huge mistake. Coming over to the US on JAL, they checked my luggage all the way through to my final destination (RDU) and all was smooth. Returning to Tokyo, American Airlines refused no, matter who I spoke to. I was willing to pay for the luggage fees (despite being in business on JAL from JFK) and begged to have them check them all the way through. No go. After this, the flight up to JFK was delayed and the prognosis wasn’t good early on. While trying to get help from a gate agent for rebooking options, I was yelled at! In the end, as a seasoned traveler, I made had to make complicated arrangements to make sure I could get the following day’s connection. The terminal at JFK is substandard as well. The gates are far from the check-in and there are not enough TSA agents working. This is only the second time I’ve flown this routing from Japan to RDU and both times there was only ONE TSA lane open for the entire American Airlines terminal! People were going ballistic! In short, the customer service level of American Airlines is disgraceful and disgusting. Shouting at passengers, unwilling to check bags on partner airlines internationally, delays, and shabby aircraft all made for a horrible experience with them. I’ll never fly them again. I’d say it was like traveling in a developing nation, but even those countries have better facilities, aircraft, and customer service.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Raleigh Durham,April 2018,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,,1,Recommendedno

The trip was to begin at 6:30 PM but did not begin loading unitl 8:30. Then we sat on the plane until 9:30 when we started out of the tarmac and began to taxi and the pilot came over and said the check engine light has came on again, we will need to return to the gate. 30 min later he advised us that United Airlines were in our gate and we were stuck on the tarmac. At 11:00 PM the pilot said we will give everyone an opportunity to deboard the plane, but within 1-2 min after the announcement the pilot came back on the intercom and stated they needed to do a quick engine test and that all passengers were to remain seated, only those in first class had the opportunity to deboard. Those passengers including myself who were still in the process of deboarding were directed back to our seats. Then at 11:45 the staff announced we have another problem, we sat so long we needed refueled but the staff put the fuel in the wrong tank making us unequally balanced, so fuel had to be taken out and placed in the center fuel tank. At 12:30-1 we finally left Hawaii, once at Dallas we had more delays, after missing 3 connections we then headed to a gate with a Chicago destination but unfortunately they did not put my girlfriend on the flight. We were waiting again, they then rerouted us to a direct flight to Indianapolis, we had to run to get there and once again we had a 3 hour mechanical delay. The trip is now over 24 hours and we were not served a meal the entire time, there were no vouchers given for the time inconvenience, no food vouchers as only snacks were offered in the period of 6:30 PM Sunday to 6:30 PM Monday with no time in between to eat a hot meal due to all the missed connections and literally running to the next flight to be only delayed again. In all this after many emails to customer service they only provided ""I'm sorry you had a bad experience, we hope we can do better the next time if you choose to fly with us again and offered only 15K air miles which is the equivalent of maybe $150, when I spent 100K air miles for this trip. Their defensive responses to emails were very inaccurate, unprofessional, condescending and overall poor customer service response was a perfect representation of how I was treated on the flights with American. The lack of a caring, empathetic, customer first attitude is rampant in American Airlines. I would be ashamed to treat people like jailed criminals stuck in an airborne jail cell, limited to a seat with limited movement and then given only a snack and a drink in a 24 hour period.

I bought two round-trip tickets to SAV, the flights to Savannah were great and we had no problems what so ever. The problem was on the way home when they pushed our connecting flight up by 40 minutes while we were in flight to Charlotte. I don't understand how the crew can make that decision to move a flight up by 40 minutes, meaning we missed our connecting flight which was also the last flight of the night at 11:15pm. When I called AA support she informed me that the plane didn't actually leave the ground until 11:29 pm and there is no reason they shouldn't have let us on the plane. She then said to tell the agent that we need hotel vouchers to which the agent said ""no sorry we can't"" and the representative on the phone was baffled at her response. All of us that missed our connecting flight were then kicked out of 2 terminals, no hotel, no food or water, offered to us. The AA agents in the SAV airport did provide us with snacks and drinks for our 2 hour delay so I was astonished that nothing was provided for a 12 hour delay. We were not put on another flight until 8:55 am the following morning meaning we had extra fees charged for storing our cars, missing work, and sitters. What makes me even more mad is I filed a claim with AA claims department and they sent me back the most ""we don't care"" email. Saying that AA feels that their customers should have to pay for extra cost such as hotels, transportation, parking fees, storage fees, and any other fees that we were charged for missing our flight due to the airline changing their times.

While we were waiting to leave the gate, I heard him talking and asked if he was talking to Flat Stanley. He said that no, he was taking a video of him on the plane for his daughter. One of the stewardesses yelled at him to shut it off. He asked why and explained that he was videoing this doll for his daughter. She was rude and demanding and made him shut off the camera saying he was not allowed to video staff. (Is that even a thing? I can't imagine it's a thing). The passenger complied but was talking to us other passengers and commenting when she was around that she was violating his rights and she might not have a job after he talked to the airline. I said she was probably having a bad day and he should just let it go. When we landed, the doors did not open. A man came up from the back of plane. He was dressed plainly. (jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt, I think it was.) I saw handcuffs hanging from his belt on the small of his back. He stepped into the cockpit with cranky stewardess and shut the door. The next thing I know, ""officer"" is demanding me to get out of my seat and making me stand in the aisle by the stewardesses. It is important to note that he did not identify himself to me or show me a badge. He ordered me around and informed Passenger 1 that he needed to sit there and me to wait. I asked the ""officer"" if he needed me as a witness because I saw it all and this was a horrible misunderstanding. He didn't want to talk to me and did not want my info. I could tell this was looking very bad for Passenger 1. I hastily wrote my name and number on a piece of paper from my purse and gave it to Passenger 1 and offered my help if he needed. When I was told I could deplane, Passenger 1 was still being held inside, He asked if he could take my picture so he could text it to his family so they could find me to let them know what was going on. When I deplaned there were police outside talking to the captain. Turns out, the stewardess said that Passenger 1 threatened her! I was shaking I was so angry at the lie and the injustice. I gave the officers my information and told them what happened. I waited in the airport and Passenger 1 finally came out. He was released and the officers told me all was dismissed. I cannot express strongly enough how angry and horrified I was that in United States of America, we were badgered and pushed around (By a man who did not even bother to identify himself) all because some American Airlines stewardess lied about a passenger and could have caused an innocent man to be on a do-not-fly list or worse, go to jail.

The AA biz seat isn't anything special per se, in a global context, but is certainly vastly superior to British Airways Club Class, and even better than British Airways First Class. Food was acceptable, slightly better than mediocre. The purser handling Business Class was excellent, and had the correct balance of professionalism, and personality to serve a Premium Cabin. The aircraft itself is still quite noisy, compared to an A-380, but it seemed to deal with mild turbulence well.

My most recent flight I had checked my stroller, car seat and base at my gate, when I arrived in Dallas for my layover it was nowhere to be found. When I asked for assistance it seemed that no one working for American had any idea what they were doing. One gentleman unloading baggage was trying his best to help us by calling his supervisor who took 30-40 minutes to even answer the phone. We got sent back and forth between employees who didn't feel like dealing with us and told us things like ""I honestly have no idea how to do this"". ""Baggage claim isn't answering my calls"" and things like ""You are going to have to go back to the gate you came from I don't have time to deal with this"". The most frustrating moment was when the supervisor finally showed up 40 minutes later, meanwhile I am holding my sick, hysterical child on my hip in the airport trying not to miss my next flight that leaves in 30 minutes. The supervisor drives past us in a baggage car, not even stopping saying ""you are going to have to call baggage claim and see where it is, I don't know what to tell you, it must be lost somewhere"". It was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was then told to go to my next gate and wait there so I didn't miss my next flight.

","""frustrated and speechless""",Tanveer Ahmed,Canada,2nd February 2018,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified | I would like to share the horrible experience that I had flying with American Airlines. I bought tickets from them to travel from Toronto to Houston and return. Toronto to Chicago to Houston (01/24/2018) Houston to Dallas to Toronto (01/29/18) The flight from Toronto to Houston was ok except for an hour delay. Everything turned into a nightmare when we were travelling back from Houston. Our flight from Houston was at 4:20PM (45 mins flight to Dallas) and our connecting flight from Dallas to Toronto was at 6:25PM (2hr 25 mins to Toronto). We got on the flight at 4:20 and we were stuck there for almost 1.5 hrs. According to the captain the air control did not give clearance and the plane had to refuel since it did not plan for the delay. After 1.5 hours they informed that we will not be able to catch our connecting flight from Dallas so it’s better to get off and re-book from Houston. We got off and asked to get our checked-in luggage. They said they cannot take that out and it will be going to Dallas. So we asked them what our options were since do not want to lose our luggage. During this time we got the notification that our flight was re-booked from Dallas at 7AM the next day (01/30/18), which meant we had to stay the night at Dallas. After discussing at the gate and with the flight crew they confirmed us that since we have a check-in baggage it will be better for us to go to Dallas and as it was an airline issue, accommodation will be provided for the night. We were convinced and agreed to get in the flight again and go for Dallas where we reached at 6:57PM (instead of 5:37PM) This is where everything started. After getting off the plane we went to talk to gate staff (as instructed) for our accommodation voucher and that is when they said ""Since it is not our fault, we will not be able to provide accommodation. In our system we see that it is coded for Tarmac delay due to clearance from Air Control which led to refueling"". We told them repeatedly that we were took off that plane and put back in and assured that there will be accommodation provided. We just had to talk to the gate. After that they said, ""Well sir, I do not see anything documented/coded in your account, therefore I cannot do anything. The best we can do is provide you hotels at distress rate"" The minimum amount of distress rate they offered was USD 65 without shuttle and if we wanted shuttle it would USD 75. Why would we pay anything? Was it our fault? We did not take their offer and the funny thing is the hotel we ended up staying “Days Inn hotel” was available on Booking.com for USD 65 with shuttle service. I do not know what kind of distress rate were they offering. You can find a copy of my hotel receipt below. We spent almost 2.5 hours travelling from Houston to Dallas and hearing them say that just made us frustrated and speechless. We were supposed to be at work the next day on 01/30/2018, so which meant 1 extra day leave from work.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Toronto via Dallas,January 2018,5.0,2.0,,,2.0,,3,Recommendedno

This was the return leg from LA booked on a Qantas code. Now originally I had been coming back on QF74 via SFO. However due to ATC issues in SFO three out of four flights leaving LAX were cancelled. Too their credit AA sorted the problem out and found a space on AA73 back to Sydney. That meant a bus ride back to T4 at LAX from one of the outlying terminals that AA uses. In addition a delay of 3 hours over the departure time of QF74. A separate review of the lounge at T4 but suffice to say I had a lot of time to kill. Books and phones help! Now the flight itself was on AA73 which is a B787 -9. Was keen to try this as it is the plane around which Qantas are building their future. Most if not all of my long haul is on the Airbus A380 with QF or EK. So the Boeing felt and was smaller.Ceilings were high and windows bit bigger but not as quiet as the Airbus. Being new everything had that new car feel to it! So the hard product is fine albeit I had better get used to it. It is the soft product where AA fails. On entering the craft the FA said: do I have to tell you where to go?  The food service was hurried and without any real warmth. I appreciate that FA's are working in cramped conditions and so will always ask an FA how his or her day is going and smile. US crews just seem not too care, its a job for them and they just do it on auto pilot. The famed US levels of service with a smile have long since gone. The seat, 24B was a nightmare. Exit row but so narrow and uncomfortable. The Boeing 787 is probably OK for flights up to 9/10 hours but beyond that I would not take it.

The workers at that gate directed us to a service desk to help with rerouting our flight.

We asked for a hotel voucher for the night and this was refused for the same reason - that missing our flight was our fault. They refused to do anything else.

Later, I was told by the customer service that I was bumped off to make sure that the plane would leave on time. This seems to be in conflict with what I experienced. Instead of sending me a message about me being bumped off the flight, American Airlines sent me emails about the flight being delayed. Had I been informed on time that I was not on the flight anymore, I could have gone to the re-booking counter right away. Now I ended up going to the gate and waiting there.

Much to my surprise, we landed at MIA 5 minutes early, only to be held on the tarmac for an hour, all because there was an aircraft still at the gate, so much for being early. So AA had a plane for an hour, on the tarmac just waiting with passengers who had connecting flights. To make matters worst being the concerned passenger I asked the head flight attendant a question, to which she had the audacity to rudely state that I should have flew in the night before. The nerve of her. After finally being able to deplane & having to scramble to G21, much to my demise the flight had already closed off, and instead of aiding assistance to an already frustrated me, the female agent rudely said we are not getting on. Seems like some of these females employed by AA need training. The male agent made it his priority to calm an already angered me. Good Job to him. He advised me that the airline would accept fault. You would think that my anger would have ended there. After being told that I would be placed in a hotel at the expense of the airline, I was given a $12 food voucher. Really American.

Fast forward to Monday 15th shall we, I got to the airport thinking it would be a better day but no, here I was thinking that my first class seat 4C would still be available so I could at least have one thing to smile about. I was told that I would be occupying 12A. I am awaiting a reward for that First class ticket that I purchased.

We were then contacted for the next two days with constantly changing information about our rebooking.

Finally, three days later we were put into a flight with a different airline and were able to get back to the US.

Width felt very tight, and the legroom was made difficult by a low-hanging seat and my underseat storage occupied. Also, the streaming IFE did not work for the entire flight. Things quickly got very boring. Cabin service was on par, however the flight attendants did seem very unenthusiastic. Connection in Philadelphia was pretty simple, however we had a long walk between gates that would have been difficult with a short connection time. The flying time up to Boston was very quick. I was occupying seat 20F on the Airbus A320, and it was significantly more comfortable. The seat width was the same, but I was able to get my bag further under the seat, which allowed for greater legroom. Cabin service was better on this leg, however it was a short flight.

The flight had a 24hr layover in Miami. I figured that my checked in luggage (which I paid 25$cad) would stay at the airport while I go sleep at a hotel near by. I still went to check at the baggage claim if it was there. So I saw my luggage, picked it up and went to the American Airline desk next to the baggage claim. The girl looked annoyed that I asked her why I got my luggage back if I’m flying again with them the next day. I said that I booked only 1 ticket and didn’t want to carry my luggage back and forth and especially not pay to check it in again. She replied rudely that it wasn’t her problem. I questioned her about what to do to solve my situation. She pointed upstairs and told me to ask someone up there. Without any directions to a certain desk. No “thank you” or any form of politeness. My time was running out to catch my hotel shuttle so I was in a hurry. Upstairs I only saw the regular AA check in counter where there was a huge lineup. Unfortunately I didn’t have enough time to make the line and I had to leave with much unnecessary luggage. It’s ridiculous to have to pay twice for luggage to get to my final destination.

The seating is in the 1-2-1 configuration with the same controls and hardware that our Cathay Pacific flight had on the first leg of this trip (Los Angeles - Hong Kong), my wife and I had the two center seats. The business section began with row 4. We had access to Cathay Pacific's Bridge Lounge prior to the flight which was comfortable. It was a night flight (leaving at 7.40pm) so we were served dinner soon after lift-off. The meal was average, with a first course that was inedible (grilled cheese served ice cold and so dry it was difficult to cut or chew). I didn't see anyone eat that course-I wonder if AA gets any feedback on food selections that don't get eaten? The second course, scallops for us, was good enough to eat although nothing to look forward to. The flight crew was spotty in that some were attentive and efficient (in my wife's row) and some were harried, inefficient, and surly (my row). On the whole, the crew was nowhere as good and nice as those in the other airlines we flew this trip, which were all Asian airlines so perhaps it's not a fair comparison. Unfortunately, we had flown Cathay Pacific on the flight over to Asia which is a tough airline to compare to in regards to service although frankly any Asian airline we have flown has better flight crews (more service oriented and nicer) than American Airlines' crews. The Captain was informative as we waited to take off, which was nice. The entertainment options didn't include any recent quality movies although some quality older movies were offered (like ""Casablanca""). The crew didn't bother to ask passengers to open windows when we landed in LAX which made landing a bit less comfortable. All in all we were happily surprised with the seats and aircraft but suffered through the kind of service that is characteristic of AA in our experience. This plane did offer wifi although business passengers had to pay for it ($12 for 2 hours was the shortest plan). It took so long to pull up the wifi plan options I figured the service would be to slow and didn't buy it. Apparently AA sees wifi as an additional revenue opportunity rather than a way to enhance business class and make it more competitive with other airlines. We had flown AA on a similar flight returning from Asia a few years ago and it seemed to us that AA is trying to improve their business class and it is better than it was then.

American Airlines managed to somehow cancel our tickets that were purchased months previously. The flight was critical for us as we were flying from New York to Los Angeles to connect for our international flight back to Australia later the same day. The first inkling of a potential problem was the day before when I was unable to check in online, so spent hours at an AA office in Manhattan trying to resolve the issue. I was given various explanations but ultimately they accepted no responsibility, asserting that our travel agent in Australia had cancelled or voided the tickets. Again, at the check in counter on the day of the flight, the issue remained unresolved with a supervisor basically saying that our travel agent had ripped us off. We had no alternative but to purchase new tickets (fortunately, I had made a tentative booking the day before in case it was needed, otherwise we would have likely missed our LAX connection considering all flights were full). After returning home, AA repeated their conclusion after investigating the matter that our travel agent had cancelled our tickets which of course they denied so demanded further investigation. Weeks later, American Airlines admitted that the error was theirs all along and offered to reimburse the cost of the new tickets. There was also a gesture of compensation for our inconvenience - a $50 voucher towards another flight on American Airlines - of zero value to us in Australia.

To begin with, I was in a front row, exit row window seat in their 'economy plus' area. Being in an exit row you typically have to attest that you can step up to the plate if there's an emergency and be capable of doing so. The center seat in my row ended up with an extremely morbidly obese woman who was so large she was literally covering part of my body with her own. Her armpit was resting on my shoulder. The staff did not do anything about this situation. This is first and foremost a safety violation, secondly, I did not pay to be the armrest for another human being. This is unacceptable and the airline should have moved her, myself or made other arrangements for someone so large. When the flight attendant came around with dinner, I politely refused. She stood there, literally staring at me, and barked 'How'd I know you'd say that'? Well, I don't know ma'am - do you normally eat when a strangers armpit is grazing your cheek? Perhaps that's why I declined. When we were getting set to land at LHR we were put into a holding pattern. No biggie, this happens some times. However there was no communication from the captain or crew about how long this would be. Approximately a half hour into this wait I asked the flight attendant if she had any idea how long it would be. She stood in front of me, silently removed her scarf, adjusted it, retied it and then rolled her eyes at me and said ""Honey, this happens to every flight, every day at this airport"" - um, excuse me, it doesn't. I've flown into LHR 8 times in the last 10 months on British Airways and not once have we gone into a holding pattern. Not. Once. At any rate, as that didn't answer my question, I repeated my question. She said ""do you have a layover?"" I told her yes, but that it was a 2.5 hour layover so I wasn't concerned about that so much. I didn't want to scream that I was desperate to get out from under the armpit of the person next to me. She literally walked away saying we'd land soon enough. Not to mention, she left a garbage bag at the bulkhead that was kicked over frequently by people lining up for the toilet. She never once picked up the contents - I did - because I didn't want coffee/juice/whatever was in there staining my suede shoes. I literally purchased the in-fight wifi so I could write them a complaint in real-time. I've never been so fuming at an airline in my life!

We fly Alaska Airlines 95% of the time as we have found their customer service superb and we live in the West Coast so it’s most convenient. At this time, however, there is no flight from Philly to Pitt on AK airlines so we booked a second itinerary on American. When we had originally checked in, they would not link our two separate itineraries even though Alaska Airlines did flying down. So we will have to get our bags from baggage claim and drop them, then go through the whole process of checking in our bags/security before our next leg of our long journey home. Apparently, American is undergoing ""budget cuts"" (literally, one of the gate attendants said this) and when you buy a ticket it’s not the same as buying a seat. So you have to pay extra to verify that you A) get a seat and B) get to sit with your party on the plane. Alaska Airlines does not ever make us do this. Again, the woman at the gate had deplorable customer service skills, very rude and curt. Not sympathetic or apologetic at all. She said to ""calm down"" even though I was obviously less than pleased but not acting out in any way. We almost weren’t going to get on our flight because they overbooked — are you surprised? Luckily, two passengers were willing to take a later flight for incentive allowing us to get on the plane. It seems that Americans Airlines is clearly struggling financially and in their professional development of staff. They might as well just close up shop because no one recommends flying on their airline anyway. If I pay $600 RT for a ticket from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh I expect to have a seat and be greeted with a smile. That should not be so much to ask. I have heard Alaska Airlines is adding a leg from Seattle to Pitt.

They have a new policy: they do not check luggage from one of their flights to another of their flights if it is on a separate reservation. If I had booked the tickets on the same passenger name record, it would have cost $2,000 more. American Airlines (along with UAL) seems to revel in seeing how much lower they can plumb the depths of customer service. Although I am platinum elite with this company, on this itinerary they tried twice to collect $25 for a checked bag onto an international flight for a Platinum member (two reasons why the checked luggage is free - want a third? I have an AA credit card). Then they tried to blame Alaska Airlines (a very bizarre attempt to shift responsibility). Delta checks luggage onto Air France and KLM and any other carrier they have a baggage agreement with, and so does UAL (even though I would avoid them because no one wants to be dragged off the airplane and beaten in the gate lobby). AA doesn't even have a ticketing/baggage agreement with AA anymore, so I guess not only are passengers blackballing the company but other airlines as well. In addition, with my platinum status I am supposed to have access to their lounges on international bookings. However, it was refused me this time b/c the connexions were extending past 24 hours even though every connexion was valid and legal. I spoke to a supervisor in the Admirals Club, but it seems AA doesn't empower any of its staff to make logical business decisions in order to serve the public. I was told I could pay $59 for a perquisite that is supposed to be gratis. By the time I made it over to the AA Eagle concourse at LAX, I was then within this 24-hour window and could use the lounge. Like I said, they seem to relish putting their thumbs in the eyes of the public, and I blame the airline companies in America (not in Europe where they are without exception gracious and hospitable to their passengers) for the increase in ""air rage"" incidents by always doing their best to enrage the public with their fees and poor service.

There were two rounds of drinks and a cookie on these 6-hour flights; the optional food for sale was tasty but expensive. The flights between MIA and MVD (# 989 and 984) were on an old-looking B763 with archaic video screens on the ceiling, small overhead bins, and a mostly friendly and efficient cabin crew, though 1 or 2 of them looked like they didn’t want to be there (on # 984 they didn’t even distribute headphones for the movie or audio service unless passengers requested them) and a male attendant consistently skipped passengers during drink rounds and never acknowledged a “thank you”.

While it is hard to describe what exactly went so well, I will try - the crew: this was probably most important. The crew was very nice and helpful throughout the flight. They brought more water all the time (very important on planes) and was just always there when you needed something. They would also take your trash with them, even when they were just passing by. Some were a little bit stressed toward the end of the flight but that was ok since they were working hard. This was especially obvious after I took my flight back with Iberia from MIA-MAD where it took them a full 2.5 hrs after takeoff to serve drinks for the first time. It was an overnight flight and people wanted to use the time to sleep. I snagged a main cabin extra seat for free using my status, so I had additional legroom, that was great! Also the lavatories were still very clean, even after 11.5 hrs of flight. As we all know, economy class food isn’t especially known for its quality. What we had though, was very good for economy. It was fried chicken in Chinese sweet sauce or something with rice. The sides were fine, as was the breakfast. I was really impressed. (Dinner was also tasty on Iberia but the breakfast was just average I’d say). In the rear part of the plane, the crew had two nice sets of snacks and soft drinks for everyone to have as much as they’d like. They also constantly refilled everything and you could ever ask them for other things they didn’t put out there. Also, they would talk to passengers, it was like a place to socialize! Really amazing for economy. The only thing I didn’t enjoy so much was the temperature. While it was ok for lots of people, I often think it’s a lil bit cold on the planes but the crew assured me, they would turn the heating up a bit for me. Didn’t help so much after all, but that’s ok.

Seats in C are in a herringbone 1-2-1 configuration. Same seats as CX and these are one of the best seats in C for space and comfort. IFE was AVOD, selection good, Bose headphones supplied, screen not very responsive, but visually good. However, irritating ads before every selection, that could not be skipped or fast forwarded. Dinner (chose the quinoa crusted prawns) was actually tasty on this flight and quality in line what I would expect in transatlantic business class. It was a night flight, so tray service, but service did not feel rushed just to get it over with. Drinks selection good as well and with regular top ups. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc was a good choice. Slept thru breakfast, so cannot comment on it, but FA’s offered to bring some coffee just before landing, which was much appreciated.

As I settled into my seat, I watched my luggage being loaded on the plane parked next to me. I alerted the flight attendant, who quickly reached out to the supervisor to intervene. After much discussion and delay, I finally saw the baggage handlers walk my suitcase over to the stairs of our gangway. Eureka! I saved myself the extra hassle of recovering my luggage after Qatar so skillfully and autonomously managed several potential baggage issues on the other legs of my trip, or so you would think. Even though I was able to intervene enough to get my suitcase to the door of the plane, it actually never made it inside. Whatever happened at that moment saw my luggage delayed until the next flight, 2 hours later. Not impressed by the 'we-don't-really-care-about-you-or-your-luggage' attitude.

The food was nice and just the right amount to be full but not bloated. Inflight entertainment selection was really good. Leg room and seat width were fine for me (average height and build).

They had an Express Connection pass waiting for all passengers connecting within 2 hours which meant I skipped a lot of queues. They had staff at multiple points to direct passengers, so I made it to my next flight an hour after getting off the first one, and had time to grab a coffee.

They overbook and the planes are very much out of date. Our plane in August to St. Thomas looked straight out of 1970 with no in flight entertainment. Still even has ashtrays. How is that for a 4 hour flight? We paid way too much for that type of service! Unfortunately where we live and want to fly to, we have 2 choices which are AA and Delta. From now on, we will try and take Delta. Our last 3 experiences with AA have been lackluster. We were bumped from our return flight we made 7 months in advance with little compensation. They put us up at a hotel and gave us each $20 for dinner, breakfast, and lunch. Breakfast alone was $23 per person plus tax for a buffet so you can imagine how much lunch and dinner was. The hotel AA put us in said AA overbooks and bumps people often! Not to mention the extra money we had to pay for pet sitters and time missed from work coming back over 24 hours late. They made very little apologies. After emailing back and forth, I finally got $200 flight vouchers. But it didn’t come easy. Plus we have to go through Charlotte, NC for connecting flights which is the rudest airport I have ever been in.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Knoxville,October 2017,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,Recommendedno

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the qiosks are meant for busy times. There were enough staff members to help those who were in line but they appeared to be too busy to do their job.

I explained to her that the other airlines were still operating and asked if they could take care of my ticket with another airline, that was denied. At one point the supervisor got on the line and said to me ""I am not sure why you are wasting your time talking to us when you could be booking a ticket with another airline."" If all flights were cancelled I would have understood, but only mine was. Which really frustrated me, if you cannot fly into that specific airport, reroute the flight and fly into one that you can.

Then they found a different flight leaving about 3 hours later with another connection in Charlotte. When we arrived in Charlotte, the American Airlines gate area was a total mad house. People standing everywhere up against each other and people sitting on the floor, because of American Airlines problems. It felt like there was no air conditioning, because of all the people in a small area. They were all talking on the microphones at the same time, mentioning delays and offering 900 dollars or more for giving up flights. Now the connecting flight in Charlotte then was delayed several times. Because of all the problems with American Airlines, I missed a lunch and dinner.

After that, they made us wait 3 more hours outside in the boarding area, with little to no help from the staff on when we were going to leave, before they told us the whole flight had been cancelled. I was going to miss a whole day of seminars that I had to attend. Then I was like its okay, mistakes happen, and then rebooked the flight for the next morning at 6AM since they had no more available flights on that day.

I had to call their customer service an try to rebook, since I had to get to Philly as soon as I could. The staff on the phone were horrible, first they said there were no more flights availble on that day to philly, (In which there were because I could literally see that there were available flights - I was looking at it on my phone when I was talking to them). Then I asked them if they could switch me to another airline, in which they said that it was not possible. I hung up the call out of frustration, and called them back a few minutes later, this time someone else picked up. I asked him the same question I asked the other guy, that if they could switch me to another airline. This time, the answer was different. He said he could switch me over to united. I was shocked, because the other guy told me they could not do that. The united flight was later in that day, so by then the program I was going to attend in Philly would be over, so I decided to ask for a refund. I had to scream at the guy to let me get a refund because he was refusing to give it to me for ""privacy"" purposes, which didn't make sense at all. Even after all that I went through, I could not understand how someone could not give someone their money back. After about an hour of yelling and convincing, he finally gave me a refund.

The price was more than 70% cheaper than any other airline operating the route, however if I knew the misery we would have to endure then I definitely wouldn't have flown with AA. The first problem arose at check in (GLA-PHL) where we were allocated new seats from the ones we had previously purchased resulting in my family being split up throughout the aircraft.

My biggest complaint is when I was dropped off by a tour company at Las Vegas (after a 14 days trip) for my return trip home 6+ hours before the flight boarded American refused to check my bags. They said their policy was not to accept baggage until four hours before a flight. Effectively I was being asked to sit in the main departure lobby for 3.5 hours to check luggage. This was unacceptable. After I complained to a self-check attendant she finally agreed to issue boarding passes and said we could gate check one piece of luggage each complimentary. I had been unable to check in electronically due to the tour and spotty internet access. We carried four pieces of luggage, one carry-on each and one piece each we intended to check, to Gate D which is a really long hike. We did this and were accommodated but had to sit with the luggage all evening and take it with us when we went to eat. None of this made sense. Why would American risk making a customer angry and forego $50 ($25 each checked bag x 2) in revenue by refusing to check bags on arrival and forcing gate check? We were tired, hungry, facing a red-eye flight and just wanted to be shed of the baggage. Now let's backtrack to our departure from Greenville-Spartanburg. The flight crew did not show up on time. The captain and first flight attendant showed up for the flight at 7:50 for an 8:05 flight. The other attendant/s and co-captain showed up at 8 sharp. Needless to say we left late. Our connection through DFW was not pleasant. When our flight landed we sat on the tarmac for over 30 minutes waiting for a gate. We were told we would taxi to three different gates before the plane actually moved to the original one. We barely made our connection with time for a restroom break. When we departed Las Vegas McCarran to return home the rest rooms at Gate D used by American were filthy. A janitorial staff member was present but did not appear to be doing much. Many urinals in the men's room were cordoned off and out of service. The final leg from Charlotte to Greenville-Spartanburg was on a very old CRJ500 that was so old the upholstery on the head rests was peeling off.

I arrived in Washington DC at IAD 2 hours before my 7.20 am flight to find that it had been delayed to 10.30 am and my connecting flight in Dallas had subsequently been changed to accommodate for the delay. Even though I asked two employees, nobody could give a definitive answer as to why the flight was delayed 3 hours. I realize that these things happen and my connection had been altered so I wasn't too upset with the changes, but once it was time to board the now 10.30 am flight things started to de-escalate. They boarded some passengers and then stopped and made everyone get off the plane because, our pilot was missing! There was a major miscommunication about where the pilot was and the flight staff didn't have much information to tell us at first. We later found out that he was at least an hour away at another airport in DC. Knowing that I only had a 1 hour layover between my newly rebooked flights, I was panicking. We were finally allowed to re board our flight after many miscommunications about the pilots whereabouts and the flight attendants seemed to find the entire situation comical or maybe they were trying to lighten the mood for their unpleased passengers?

We boarded the flight and then was told there was a mechanical. Not a problem. I’m a million miler and understand. As soon as the problem was fixed the pilots timed out. Once again I totally understand. I don’t want a fatigued pilot flying the plane and it is an FAA rule that the airline can’t ignore. The problems started after all this. They said they were getting new pilots and it could take a couple of hours so they wanted everyone to deplane. At this point I’m not thrilled but at least we are going to make it to Omaha and I should be able to at least get in a half a day’s work the next day. We wait for two hours and still no pilots. They make an announcement that the pilots are coming in on a flight in 15 minutes and will be at the gate directly across from us. That was great news but a total lie. A few minutes later I hear someone on a radio say the pilots had never acknowledged the tag. My understanding is pilots never respond to these requests so I’m not sure why they even try or get the passengers hopes up. So the plane lands and deplanes I see the pilots get off and walk away. The gate has still not told anyone. About a half hour later the gate agent announces the flight is officially cancelled. The airline knew there was a shortage of pilots and no one ever accepts a tag so why did they hold us all captive for four hours after they knew the flight would cancel anyway. I would have been fine if as soon as the pilots timed out they cancelled the flight knowing they didn’t have any pilots to cover it. Things like this are why people hate airlines.

Flight AA1048 was delayed over 4 hours (scheduled departure time was supposedly 3:30pm from Miami and arriving at JFK at 6:30pm), which resulted to my boyfriend and I not making our connecting flight to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. We ended up departing Miami airport at 7:30pm and arriving at JFK at 10:10pm at terminal 8. Our flight back home was scheduled to depart at 10:45pm at terminal 4 with Etihad Airlines. The staff at American Airlines (both at Miami and the JFK airport) had no concept of urgency, sensitivity or care to its passengers. Gate changes were made without clear announcements (D4 to D23) and passengers were not informed in a timely manner about reasons for the flight delay. Sporadic announcements were made when it was clear that passengers were becoming even more restless and agitated as their patience was being stretched beyond their capacity. One bit of information that was announced was that the plane was ready to leave however, the cabin crew was waiting for one flight attendant who was running late. This was actually ridiculous considering the flight was already late for 3 hours and she was still late.  I do acknowledge that the pilot informed us in a timely manner the reasons for the further and ongoing delay, which was nice. Furthermore, I do also acknowledge his amazing pilot skills steering us through the crazy turbulence and landing the plane in such a smooth and gentle way.  AA staff at JFK were rude, abrupt and showed no courtesy. After the plane landed, my boyfriend and I tried to get off the flight as soon as possible and when we managed to get through to the gate front desk, I spoke to a lady explaining to her that my boyfriend and I had a flight in 45min but she just brushed us off and said that since we didn't book the connecting flight with AA, there's nothing they can do. I asked her if it was possible if she could call the other terminal to notify them that we were on the way and she just said, ""Nope we can't do that and there's no way and that we missed our flight considering the time involved with baggage claim"". We asked her how to get to terminal 4 and what was the fastest way and she just advised ""go up that way and follow the signs"" in her monotone.

I was then directed by Latam airlines (connecting airlines) to an American Airlines office; sadly no one was working at this office at 4 pm.

When I described my travel difficulties to an American Airlines representative, I was told that there were no guidelines that would fulfill my request for a refund.

I'm not one who is usually compelled to write a review but the service I experienced this weekend flying on American Airlines was so horrible that I had to. It all began when I believed I left my debit card at the ticketing counter when I paid to check my bag. After exiting security and returning to the check in area, I approached an attendant and kindly asked him if anyone had turned in a debit card as I had lost mine, the guy doesn't even look up from what he is doing and rudely yells ""did anyone turn in a debit card? No?"" Then looks at me and says ""retrace your steps, it's not my problem."" Finally I get past security and to my gate, we board the plane and begin to take off. A passenger gets sick before we even take off so we return to the gate, completely understandable. After waiting for 30 minutes for them to clean up, we are informed that they need to ""wax the plane down"" which took another 45 minutes. It was at this point that the pilot stated that he informed all AA crew we were delayed so we could get to our connecting flights in Charlotte. 45 minutes into the ""waxing"" we were informed we were returning to the gate yet again due to possible damage to the tail. I needed to get to Buffalo that night due to an important engagement early the next day so I decided to exit the plane and attempt to get on another flight that night. The flight attendant rudely stated overhead that anyone exiting the plane would not be welcome back on if they took off soon. My last straw was booking another flight and due to AA already rebooking my Charlotte flight for the next evening, they were refusing to put me on a flight that left that night so I had to repurchase another ticket with the ""possibility of a refund"" which was eventually denied. Everyone from the checkin counter to the flight attendants and gate staff were awful. I don't even think they know what being polite or a smile is.

Upon arrival to Phoenix our flight was running late, the flight attendant was aware of 2 groups of people with tight connections and all they did was to tell the plane to let those with tight connections to get off 1st and both groups were in the back of the airplane. We know how that worked out, we all got off last. They did not call the tower to say we were running late as reported to me by the person at the gate for Boston. There was only 30 minutes between reported landing time in Phoenix and lift off time to Boston if the 1st flight arrived on time. The gates were over 1/2 mile apart. I was the youngest in our group of three turning 65 this year and the oldest was 82. This information is all known by the airline upon booking a ticket on line.

Thankfully there was a seat between myself and the other passenger in my row, otherwise we would literally be squashed in, banging elbows and almost would be impossible to eat comfortably without encroaching on the space of the person next to you.

I wasn't uncomfortable in normal main cabin where I'd see paying extra worthwhile. Food is to be as expected when flying economy, it was acceptable but I've had better presented, tastier food on economy with other airlines. Drink choice was bare minimum acceptable.

About an hour or so before my flight I was notified that my flight was delayed until 9:15pm which meant I would miss my connecting flight. When I went to the ticket counter, there was no rep there. I waiting with another passenger for around 30 min before a rep showed up. When I was finally able to ask her what was going on with my flight she informed me that they had canceled the flight and that it would be leaving the following morning. When I asked her why she said they didn't have enough people to man the flight. I asked her to put me on another flight, but there were no more flights that day. Keep in mind this was around 6pm. When I asked for a refund she said she couldn't do that and looked away from me back at her screen. When I asked how to get a refund she told me in a very sarcastic voice to ""just call American."" At that point I unloaded on her and her horrible customer service and went to Delta and bought another ticket for $171.38. When I called AA to get a refund they told me it would take up to 10 days and that they couldn't tell me what amount would be refunded. I waited 11 days with no refund. When I called back in to AA they said no one had filled the refund. Once again I had to go through the process and wait. I finally go a notice that my refund of $115 was being ""processed"" but could take up to 5 days to complete. When I reached someone in customer service they seemed very unapologetic, like I was a nuisance. I tried to get someone to explain to me why my refund, which should have been $214 because of the seats I purchased, was so low they said, ""that is the amount our refund department issues.""

No problem as we had 1 x 2.5 hour layover for a connecting flight. However, time went on and the departure time kept getting extended for no reason given. We were instructed that the flight would still occur. When the flight showed a departure time of 9.51 (almost 2 hours past its original time - and keep in mind the flight is only a 45 minute flight from Milwaukee to Chicago), I went up to find out what was going on. Fortunately a pilot was there and told me that the 1st plane had mechanical issues and then another was sent for and it returned for mechanical issues and that they were looking for another plane. They were talking about getting a bus to send passengers to Chicago. Unfortunately, that would no longer be an option as it would take at least 2 hours to drive, park and get to gate - which means we would be missing our connecting flight. Why didn't someone make that decision sooner - or at least let us know as I could have driven to Chicago or got my own transportation. No communication. When a gate agent finally arrived, she said she could change our flight to get us to our destination, but it was not leaving until 4 pm (we had been at the airport since 6.20 am). So now we had to wait until 4 pm to leave and it was 10 am at that point. We were later given some food vouchers by a ticketing agent as the gate agent seemed to think that this was normal for AA and she agreed with us but there was nothing she could do. When we tried to use the vouchers - which states only good for food and beverages - at Nonna's restaurant, they refused to honor part of it as we had two drinks with our food and they stated that it did not include alcoholic beverages - which it does not state on the voucher anywhere.

My husband and I have been married for three years, but we never had a honeymoon. So we saved up our money to decide where we would go within the next five years. He had to have major surgery, so we scheduled for this year. He’s never flown before and was excited and anxious. We made a reservation with Carnival Cruise to coincide with our anniversary but before his surgery, because life is short. Everything was fine as we filled up our Expedition for the two hour drive to Lambert Airport. We found parking and got on the park shuttle. I knew a little bit from prior experience, but my husband was worried and nervous. The first thing out of place I noticed was when we were at the gate waiting to board. The captain and crew got on about ten minutes before we were called to board. There was a request for anyone with a carryon with wheels to check them at the desk due to a full plane. As we boarded I noticed the captain laughing and holding a conversation with two flight attendants already aboard. Then the problems started. It took a while because the flight attendants were trying to find space overhead for everyone’s carry-ons (we didn’t have any.) The captain taxied off, then stopped. He told us we had to wait awhile for the plane to be de-iced. (That took 50 minutes.)  He taxied again and went around three times. Finally, he told us that his compass wasn’t aligned and he needed to have maintenance take a look at it. But, there was no gate available, so we would have to wait until one opened for him to dock. (That took another 30 minutes.) During this wait, one of the female flight attendants told us to call or go online to rebook if we had connecting flights out of Chicago. I called immediately and was told by a representative she could not rebook us while we were still on the plane. I explained that we needed to catch our connecting flight from Chicago at 8:30am and if we missed it we would miss our cruise. Absolutely no sympathy given. Finally we docked. After 30 more minutes of uncertainty, the captain told us the plane is being put out of service. I called the cruise line for help to get to our port in Miami, while my husband called American Airlines to see what can be done. We got off the plane and was told little to no info. We asked where our luggage would be and told it would be held until we had another flight. The rep found us another flight, but it would make it there after the cruise had already departed. Mind you, one flight had already boarded and ready to leave at 7:19am. Too bad we were stuck on the tarmac. The cruise line couldn’t find a plane for us because all flights were booked and full. We made several phone calls trying to salvage our delayed honeymoon to no avail. Finally, we accepted defeat and requested a refund and looked for our luggage.

However, the experience of the check-in counter people is amazing to me. They are slow. Which in my observation is not a ticket counter issue but a archaic technology issue.

As I am trying to get all 8 separated from the connecting flight boarding passes she threatens to keep me off the plane ""if I throw one more boarding pass at her"". I was sliding them off the stack of paper I was holding onto the counter. None touched her or even went to the edge. She comes around the counter to tag our bags telling me I would have had to check mine anyway. I responded that I've never had any problem with it as a carry on in 5 years with numerous airlines.

I took the boarding passes from her and she said that she could keep me off the plane until I cooled down and that she was going to tell the pilot about me. I did not raise my voice, curse, or even argue at any point throughout this encounter. I said nothing and boarded the flight as I needed to get to my wedding.

Then I had a connection from Miami to Montevideo using American Airlines. The difference between these 2 experiences was staggering. When I finally cleared imigration in Miami (although I was in transit) which took over 2 hours I went to the business class lounge the staff were pleasant and the lounge not too bad but the food was minimal and not up to business class standard and I was given a voucher for 2 drinks. I use lounges all over the world and this is the first one I have ever used that expected you to pay for your drinks. I don't think American Airlines have any idea what business class passengers expect and I doubt if they care. We then went to the gate although they don't give you any information when you should go. When we arrived at the gate we had our boarding passes that had been issued in London (I was travelling with my brother) I went through fine but they stopped my brother and told him they had changed his seat. I asked the incompetent at the gate why? No apology in any form I was just told it was nothing to do with him and he couldn't do anything. I asked for the purser once on board and these 2 women turned up one was the purser and one was ground crew when we explained that we were not happy that this had happened they again gave no apology and said they it wasn't to do with them and what did they expect me to do throw people out of their seats? (ironic as this is just what they did to us). When we pointed out that there was something wrong with a system that allowed this to happen the purser got defensive and threatened to have us thrown off the aircraft. Just bullying us. All the time this was happening this was stood up in front of all the passengers a very unpleasant experience and dreadful customer service. The plane was tired, narrow seats that when you tried to lie down you felt that you were in a coffin, no built in entertainment centre, I didn't eat dinner but had breakfast which was appalling. All the crew were wearing different clothes so they had no attention to detail and no uniform in the true sense of the word.This is the worst airline I have ever flown.

My flight was delayed in Philadelphia for an hour, which caused me to missed my connecting flight in San Francisco to Sydney. After contacting American Airlines before touchdown in San Francisco, I was informed that they would put me up in a hotel and my flight would be changed to the next night. When I arrived at the terminal in San Francisco, I went to the American Airline desk and asked who I could talk to about my accommodation due to my missed flight. The first thing the women, who ended up being a supervisor, said to me was ""Well what time is your flight?"" I responded and told her that my flight to Sydney was supposed to depart at 11:25 pm -- her response, ""Well, it's only 10:50"". From there on I was in complete shock, what kind of response is that? I felt as though she was making assumptions about what I knew/ did not know before even asking me my name or flight number. I explained to her that I was already booked on another flight for the next night and for anyone who has flown internationally, as well as ever been to the San Francisco airport, knows it would be impossible for me to have made that flight (I was also already told prior to landing that they would not hold my flight to Sydney and there was nothing they could do except accommodate me). She then proceeded to tell me there was nothing she could do because the delay was due to the weather and not mechanics which sounds ridiculous to me. Not once did she ask me my name, my flight or anything. She was very inconsiderate and made me feel like this problem was my fault and it was not her's to deal with. She handed me a slip with an 800 number that I could call for a hotel. My main issues with the situation above were that from the start there were inconsistencies with their accommodations and what their employees are told. No one should have told me I would have been put up in a hotel if that was untrue. Second, was that this woman could not have cared less about a paying customer.

Travel is difficult for me because of multiple back surgeries so I purchase first-class tickets for long flights. This itinerary was Phoenix to Medellin return via Miami. On the segment from Miami to Medellin there are only two rows of first-class seats. In order to squeeze in another coach row, American put in a divider between first class and coach immediately behind the second row of first class seats. Thus, both on the segment from Miami to Medellin and Medellin to Miami our 1st class purchased seats would not and could not recline. The stewardesses basically begged us to write a letter to American about this. On the tarmac in Miami we heard rumblings about not enough room for the luggage. When we arrived in Medellin, our first class priority tag luggage was not on the plane. Nor was the luggage for at least 20% of the plane. There had not been room in the luggage hold, which I assume means they took on cargo in preference to passengers' luggage who were flying on that plane. Since there is only one flight a day American would not get our luggage to Medellin until 9:30 PM the following night. They would not deliver our luggage to us at night. Thus, in order to catch our internal connection at 5:30 AM the following morning we had to drive approximately one hour each way. We arrived at 9:30 PM and were kept waiting in the hall until 10:30 PM as they would not give us our luggage until all the passengers on the flight just landed had disembarked and claim their luggage. I contacted American Airlines. They never formally accepted responsibility nor took me seriously. The compensation they offered, I assume to get us off their back, was significantly less than you would offer a traveler who was bumped.

This was only communicated to us after we were at the airport and were given several updates of the flight status. The American Airlines manager falsely secured hotel rooms at a local hotel that had no availability. He issued taxi vouchers to the hotel and when the taxi company found out that he was sending people to the hotel that had no vacancies, they communicated this to rest of the stranded passengers trying to find lodging. The manager would not even come down to baggage claim to address the situation with everyone who was trying to find lodging for the night. I was finally able to find lodging at a nearby Marriott and only due to my platinum status were they able to find me a room. My family and I finally arrived at our hotel at 2am and were exhausted and stressed out to no end. I was able to work with my travel agent and have American Airlines get us on a United flight the next day which was amazing. The American Airlines plane that we flew on from Dallas to Honolulu was very antiquated and did not have screens or USBs compared to the state of the art plane that we flew on with United to Chicago. Upon my return I was instructed to contact American Airlines customer service for reimbursement for our hotel, taxi, meals etc. Some of the AA customer service were very helpful, but the last representative would not allow me to speak with a supervisor or have a supervisor contact me to discuss complete reimbursement for my hotel. She told me that I would have to accept AA's contracted rate for a hotel regardless of my situation and stated that they offered my family $200 vouchers to use on a future AA flight. I told her that vouchers do not compensate me for expenses incurred by a hotel that I was required to secure due to their flight cancellation. All I can say is the cancellation is one thing, how they handled the cancellation is another story and the reimbursement for insult and injury is truly another chapter. Suffice to say for a difference of $300 which is what it would have required to compensate me completely, they have not only lost 4 customers, they have potentially lost many more after I share my experience. Do yourself a favor and use another airline for your travel as I would hate for another family to experience such a terrible ending to an amazing family vacation",Family Leisure,Premium Economy,OGG to CLE via DFW,January 2017,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Recommendedno

My next flight was delayed for weather issues (which I know we can't control-gave an obvious pass here), but was then delayed for yet another mechanical problem (twice in one day AA-really?).

I was on vacation and found out I needed to head home to Canada ASAP just two days before intended departure (mind you, this was New Year's Eve). I looked all over the web looking for tickets with many different airlines and agencies and found nothing but economy tickets at prices typical of first class. American Airlines also were full of ridiculously overpriced last minute seats, that is except for one route through PHL and BOS which were almost fully booked and therefore was a dirt cheap ticket even compared to normal season tickets. I jumped on the opportunity and booked my tickets via PayPal, which made everything much faster and simpler. Upon getting to the airport I realized I needed to buy a tag for my duffle bag in order to get it checked... not the most enticing thing but it was a fast process through the machine and was taken care of within a matter of seconds. Upon boarding, I was not expecting much, granted, this flight was American Eagle and they are not exactly renowned for premium service. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of comfort the seat had, and the flight attendants were in a good mood as well. Complimentary service on the flights were the same, a bag of pretzels and drinks, but who needs more than that on a flight that's 1.5 hrs long? I might also add that having my connecting gate exactly next to my arriving gate in PHL was a very rare and warm surprise. Gate attendants were friendly and cheerful, and seemed to be level with what they were doing. In summary, American is by no means a high-class airline to me, but I guess I was lucky in having been under the care of some really great people and it was well worth the low cost of the ticket.

There was a dedicated check in desk for business passengers and when I arrived there was only one other couple in front of me. Check in quick and efficient. No problems encountered.

On boarding I was direct to my seat and once seated asked if I would like a drink, went for Champagne (very nice too). Flight attendants very attentive, refilling my glass when it became empty. Inflight entertainment, for business class passengers on the 767 you are given a Samsung tablet and Bose headphones.

Just a simple “go stand in that line”. The complaints from my fellow passengers echoed my own disbelief that at one point less than five desk staff were there to serve the long line of people and there was no coordination of passengers who had little time until boarding.

I had no money on me and my cards were in my hand luggage as I didn't think they were needed. These were put in the hold anyway as there was no space in the lockers, but I did not know AA was a budget airline and the whole ""money, money, money is everything"". I got a ""free"" glass of water and went hungry. I then had a tight connection at ORD so had to get straight to the next gate (it said free soft drink is back with much fanfare, so yes, they must have tried to remove even that). I was pleased to see a new aircraft, but it ended there. The staff were such a mixed bunch, never seen a flight crew like it, it was almost as if they were volunteers. Anyway, they were nice enough, a million miles from a full service airline but reckon they gave all they could with their working conditions.

I don't know, it was like coleslaw with no mayo and sat in vinegar for days on end until it wilted. Must have been the cheapest thing the catering firm had, it was beyond vile. Simply not edible. The teeny ""main"" was beyond it as well, little drops of pasta that were so overcooked it liquefied upon contact with tongue and tasted of nothing. Just unbelievable. The BBQ ""chicken"" was highly processed, bland and a perfect partner for the horror of it all. Maybe 5,000 flights, this was the most pathetic assortment of rubbish I'd ever been given. Then there was a tiny square of sponge with jam and coconut. I can't eat coconut but hey, the whole thing was vile.

Hands down the worst airline experience I have ever had. Almost every agent, flight attendant, and other airline staff were inefficient, disgruntled, or rude.  I would never recommend this airline. On flight out we had a super old plane that was making all kinds of weird/loud noises. We were on the same plane out of Phoenix and they wouldn't take off with the noise so we returned to the gate and sat for over an hour and a half with no information on what was wrong (just the repeated ""technical issue"" update at about 15 mins intervals and no cabin service). The plane was completely powered off at one point which meant no lights/air for a period of time. When we finally made it to Tampa the power also went off as we were trying to de-board. Fast forward to the return flight and after waiting in a super long line, the curbside check-in didn't work and they wouldn't tell us why. Had to wait in another line to check our stroller inside and the agent there was convinced we were traveling to San Francisco, Costa Rica, not CA. Printed off boarding passes for Tampa and Phoenix in a horrible jumble which we were forced to sort ourselves at security with (at this point) screaming children in tow. Barely made the flight and we were at the airport almost 2 hours in advance. In Phoenix we discovered for some reason our boarding passes no longer had priority on them but group two. I had to wait at the counter for at least 15 mins (children now screaming again) while the agent completely ignored me, and when I was finally able to ask if we could board with priority as we had on every other leg I was very rudely interrupted as the agent said repeatedly, ""what's written on your boarding pass, what's written on your boarding pass?"" We were in the back of the plane that leg - with a four-year old and two-year old. Boarding in group 2 was an absolute nightmare and we held up a bunch of other people. We are also (or I should say were as of today) platinum card holders, but because my father booked the trip for us that didn't matter. At least the plane was newer on that leg, but super bare-bones for the age. Couldn't get the in-flight streaming option to work either (they only support for a limited number of browsers).

The inflight service was terrible; bad food, small servings, irresponsive crews, overcrowded lavatories, smaller aisle. This was all bearable until I reached Los Angeles for my 14 hours layover for my flight to Mexico city. The flight was suppose to depart at 23:55 at first, then delays of 20, 50, 120 minutes was announced until the flight was announced cancelled. Along with 6 other flights in LAX, American Airlines cancelled these flights altogether creating a mayhem in LAX. The airline has a customer service counter with 2 desks, just 2! And any other AA personnel you see in the airport are unwilling to answer any questions and they try to direct you to the service counter. When 7 flights are cancelled at one time, the queues to the counter are long, I mean 7-Hours long in the end. After getting reneged on your contract with AA to fly to your destination, you are forced to wait 7-hours to get an answer. So I did exactly that, and only then I knew it was because they had poor crew scheduling, resulting in insufficient crews to provide those flights. How is that even possible? With poor regulations of airline policies in the US, these airlines and airports are falling way behind with competitions from Middle East and Asia. So at the counter, I asked what do you have for me?

Since I have my activities booked in Mexico city already, i have to pay a last-minute ticket to the city on my own which cost me $600 USD. American Airlines are unwilling to do anything about it and just asked me to collect my ""checked"" luggage which is left somewhere in the airport, without anyone overseeing it.

Over the past two months I have been traveling through Europe and taken countless flights, but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. To begin with, the boarding procedure was delayed because the previous flight arrived late. After getting the plane ready the crew boarded us about 30 minutes after our original boarding time. Everyone got on the aircraft and sat and waited for a long time before being told they were experiencing mechanical issues and they were bringing people in to check out the situation. We sat and waited and then were finally told that if we would like to get off the plane we were welcome to. I proceeded to leave the plane to speak with an agent because I knew that I was going to miss my connecting flight in CLT. There was one travel agent available for a whole airplane of people and she seemed to care less about helping us because her shift was supposed to be ending. I asked if I could change my end destination to a larger airport that was within 300 miles of my original end point and I was told no. The only option they could give me was a flight out the next day. I took the new flight information and proceeded to call the service number where I was told the exact opposite information that the travel agent at the airport told me. However, there is nothing that the agents over the phone can do because they cannot physically give you a new boarding pass or vouchers to make up for the inconvenience. By the time I was about to get back in line to speak with the travel agent in person and inform her of what I was told on the phone, there was a line of about 20 people. I went back to the gate and was told to re-board the plane if we had new boarding passes and had been situated on a new flight out of CLT. I got back on the plane and sat for all of five minutes to be told that their flight crew had timed out and a new crew would not arrive for at least another hour. We once again had to exit the plane and go sit by the gate. They did provide us some snacks while we waited and the crew did not arrive until 2 hours later. There was still only one travel agent available to assist passengers who needed to re-book their flights and the customer support agents were impatient, rude, and acted as though this was our problem and not their own. I do not remember hearing the words ""I am sorry for the inconvenience"" once out of anybody. After sitting until 1:00am they finally had a crew and boarded us for a third time on the plane. It took forever to take off and we landed in CLT at about 3:30am. We were told we would receive hotel vouchers, transportation, and food once in CLT. Clearly JFK did not communicate the issues to CLT because the members in Charlotte had no idea what was going on and we had to wait another hour for a supervisor to come out and speak to us. At this point, there was no point in getting a hotel voucher because flights would be leaving within a few hours. I finally spoke with an agent who put me on an earlier flight to a different airport that was close to my original destination. He also provided me with a food voucher. This was the first time that I received answers and was helped in a caring and apologetic way. This was also the first time that I was not quickly shut down and told no.

This was one of the worst flight experiences I had ever had. Our flight was meant to leave at 530 am and due to icy weather conditions, we were delayed 6 hours. Although the staff were kind, we ended up waiting on the aircraft for hours with little to no information. When we finally took off, about an hour into the flight the pilot informed us that due to a mechanical malfunction we would have to make an emergency landing in Jacksonville (intended destination = Miami.) Again captain and crew were great - no complaints. Once we landed, we were told very little about the prognosis of our aircraft and we ended up having to wait in a huge group of 160 people as we learned very slowly that the flight could not be officially cancelled until they were certain they couldn't find a replacement captain and crew, but also couldn't help us rebook a new flight to make connections. Thus, this all resulted in zero contingency plan and lots of unnecessary waiting.

As I am aware some American Airlines planes are very old I usually try to book a flight operated by some newish Boeing 737-800 which are very common on this route: this year I wanted to fly business class (they call it First but it's just a trick) so I had limited options for ny reward ticket and I ended up in a 4:40pm flight. They changed the plane to a B757 a few weeks after my booking so in the end my flight was operated by a glorious aircraft from the '80s with extremely wide but hard seats with limited recline capability. Because of a technical issue, departure was delayed for about one hour (this happened in about 40% of all the flights I had with AA so far, kind of disturbing if you compare with other major airlines) but no big deal as I was not in a hurry. No PTV on the seat just the old fashioned hanging monitor with terrible sound and video quality, so bad they even had to interrupt the safety video because it was a torture for our ears. Flight was uneventful with a pleasant purser who greeted passengers one by one by shaking their hands both upon boarding and before landing. I did not feel like eating so did not try the meal which did look fine by the way (chicken with some vegetables).

This review is for the MIA-JFK route. I was originally booked onto a 757, international configuration with angled lie flat seats. However I took the opportunity to do a same day flight change and get an earlier flight, this would enable me to do a quick bit of shopping. Additionally the change of flight allowed me to sample a reconfigured 767, with the lie flat seats. I arrived at MIA at 6.45am for my 9.26am departure. There was no queue for the Priority check-in and I just needed to pick up my boarding passes as I was hand bag only. The check-in associate was friendly and helpful. I had access to fast track security and I was through in 5 minutes. I used the Admirals Club at Gate 30. It was a pretty pathetic offering, unlike the AA First class lounge at JFK which is excellent. The AC had a very limited free breakfast offering and I had a bagel and coffee. I was provided with a single drinks voucher which I used to get a bottle of water for the flight. Boarding commenced on time at precisely 8.56am - 30 minutes before departure. After people with access needs boarded, First class passengers were invited to board. On boarding a FA offered to hang my coat and I was offered a pre departure drink and I selected coffee. On international legs, a Samsung tablet is provided, but only main screen entertainment was offered on this short 2.5 hour flight. I was provided with in ear headphones. The seat was excellent, fully flat with plenty of space. I was seated in 6D, I would have preferred a window but none where available at checkin. I would have been happy with this seat on an international sector, so felt spoilt for a short domestic flight. The FA who looked after me was great, friendly, attentive and address me by my name. Cereal or a three cheese omelette were on offer. I chose the latter which was definitely the most popular choice. The omelette and the sausage provided were not great, but the side veggies and biscuit were excellent. After eating I promptly fell asleep for the remainder of the flight.

After checking in approximately 3.5 hours prior to departure, which is ample time for international travel, and my bag being tagged as ""Priority,"" since Monday, November 7, no one can tell me with certainty where my luggage is. In CDG I was told that I needed to give the gate agents the code for my padlocks even though they are TSA approved. I complied with their request and gave them my code. Prior to arrival in Tel Aviv, I was advised by the flight attendant that my bag had not made it on the flight and to ensure that I would file a claim with El Al at the Lost Baggage counter prior to exiting the TLV airport, which I did. The agent there told me that there were two flights coming in later, and that my case would be on one of them. They gave me a bag with very basic toiletries and what looked like a short pyjama suited for my 10 year-old granddaughter. They told me that there was no allowance until after 24 hours. I was also asked to cross off from my declaration any items over $100 so I wouldn't need to return to the airport to pay duty on those items. I questioned the accuracy of her statement, but the agent who filed my claim with El Al insisted that I had to cross off on my form what I had begun to list as items over $100 in value, which I did. That was Tuesday, November 8. On Wednesday, November 9, the hotel concierge followed up on my claim. The person he spoke with said for me to get whatever I needed and to keep all receipts. That evening the concierge followed up with El Al again, who informed us that my luggage was still in Dallas! I called back and spoke with Maya, who told me American Airlines had put my luggage on a flight to Toronto and then it was scheduled to get onto an Air Canada flight to Tel Aviv. ETA was now for Thursday morning. I am joining a Holy Land tour and had gone a few days ahead to spend visiting Jerusalem. Instead, I have been wasting my time trying to track my luggage.  A hotel guest relayed to the concierge and me that El Al had told her that if she wanted her luggage the day it had arrived, she would have to get a taxi to and fro the airport as their courier was no longer available, which she had no other choice but to do it. Armed with this information I hung tight by the hotel. On Thursday morning (I departed on Monday), the El Al call center for lost luggage would not put me through a manager as he was calling American Airlines liars. He said he would have a manager call me, which still has not happened. As of Thursday afternoon, American told my husband that they lost track of my luggage in Toronto and that they could not access El Al lost baggage system. El Al claims AA is lying as the lost luggage system is an international system, not El Al's. Until they physically have my case in their possession, El Al cannot do or say anything further. And besides being tagged ""Priority,"" they also have me as VIP in their system. I have lost the extra days in Israel. What promised to be a trip of a lifetime has become a nightmare for me.

The fact that it is advertised with all the mod cons did not concern them at all. The magazine in the seat pocket was all stuck together and some of them were totally in Spanish. The movie was a Disney movie and the people who made the outbound journey on this flight said the movie was in Spanish and could not be changed. The flight was unable to carry any duty free items as they didn't have anywhere to store it.

I paid $525 dollars to get from Gainesville, Florida to Maruqette, Michigan. I got delayed in Charlotte two times to Chicago and then both flights got cancelled. I ended up getting to Chicago past midnight where I had to sit in the airport until 3 AM where I asked to speak to a supervisor. It took her over ten minutes to come in which she proceeded to stand over in a corner and stare at everyone until one of the customer service representatives had to go remind her that I was waiting for her. When she comes over and I tell her what's going on, she denies me assistance because ""she can only help me if one of the customer assistance ladies can't help me."" Then she rudely told me, ""I'm going to direct you to the line behind you to speak to a customer representative."" After walking into the line and waiting I was speaking to the lady about rebooking my flight to Marquette. Marquette was full that day and I would have been number 13 on standby. So my options were either take a plane to Greenbay (which is 3 hours from Marquette) or wait another 36 hours in an airport to fly to Marquette. Obviously my hands were tied and I chose to go to Greenbay. I was put on standby for an 8:40 AM flight and confirmed on a flight at noon. I sat in the airport until 8 and by this point I had been up over 24 hours. The flight at 8:40 was a bit delayed, and I waited until almost everyone boarded before approaching the boarding assistant and asking them if there were any seats available for people on standby. She asked for my name, I gave it to her, and she told me I wasn't on the standby list. I showed her my ticket proving I was and she denied still that I was on the standby list. She then proceeded to ignore me for a few minutes before closing the flight, telling me she can't help me, and walked away. I needed to get on that flight because I had no way of getting from Marquette to Greenbay except for a friend who could pick me up if I had gotten on the earlier flight. I end up going up to some other people who worked at American Airlines and asked for a supervisor. They asked what the problem was and I told them. They kept telling me I wasn't on the standby list and there was nothing they could do. They ended up telling me to ""go away because there's nothing they can do to help me."" When I finally got to speak to a supervisor, she told me I ended up getting confirmed on the 8:40 flight and there was no way for me to know. This means that their worker neglected to check if I was confirmed and forced me to miss my flight for no reason other than pure laziness. When I finally get to Greenbay, I ask the supervisor there to get me to Marquette somehow. He just shrugged and told me ""he can't help me because I said it was okay for them to get me to Greenbay."" My hands were tied, I had no choice. I ended up having to rend a car for $200 and driving 3 hours sleep deprived to finally get to my destination. So while I had to pay $525 for my ticket, I ended up having to pay a total of $725 just to get to my destination.

We were booked on another flight leaving from Washington DC to Miami. So we get off the plane and take a $100 cab ride for a flight scheduled to leave Dulles at 12:45pm. We get there at about 12:15pm, go through security again, and make it the plane, only to sit on this plane for another 2 hours. Finally we leave and fly to Miami for a flight scheduled to leave a 5:55pm. We're sitting in the airport for 45 minutes and 10 minutes before the flight time they tell us to go to another gate which is in a total different wing of the terminal. So we run to the gate only to find out our 5:55pm flight is delayed. An hour later we board only to sit on yet another plane for almost 2 hours. We made it to St Thomas at 10:30pm. We were originally scheduled to arrive there at 3:30pm. So here we are 16 hours later, and have missed a half a day of our vacation, and AA thinks that was ok. The only thing they could say was oh well, you took the flight, you got there. Our return from St Thomas back home was about the same. Sitting in airports at the wrong gates and delayed flights.

We started late, sat on the tarmac for one hour and returned to the gate. This was weather related and I am ok with that.

Fortunately one of the gate crew retrieved the wheelchair for us. Otherwise it would have been an even greater disaster.

When asked about future flights we were told the first available seats were for 8:00 PM the next day. In about an hour the plane left with our luggage for another itinerary. So much for weather related cancellation. They canceled us so they could use that plane for a more profitable flight. That to me that quit being a weather related issue and became a business issue.

Everything is going smoothly up until there is a 30 minute (which turns into an unannounced 50 minute) delay on the Miami to Charlotte flight…which is fine. Delays happen, I get it. However, noticing that we would probably be cutting it close to our next flight, my friend goes to ask if there were other flights we could look into it if we didn't catch it. She starts by saying that we have a connecting flight - until he cuts her off and says “-yeah, you and everyone else.” That was the end of the conversation. I also am not naive to the fact that when people are under stress they can come off as rude, but why work in customer service if you cant handle people?

With AA, my partner and I were able to choose regular economy seats for free in advance, and the A330 with its 2x4x2 configuration is preferable to the dense 3x3x3 configuration BA offers out of PHL (no stranger sitting next to us). Also, the seat pitch is better then BA's new claustrophobic arrangement, and the seats themselves were much more comfortable. In addition, the A330 offered individual air vents, which BA do not on their aircraft out of PHL, allowing me to better control the temperature. The food on AA was better than BA as well, and complimentary wine was offered with meals, with refills freely provided. The AVOD system worked well and a USB power port was provided at each seat. Flight attendants on both flights were very courteous, and the ATH-PHL segment featured a warm meal, followed later by ice cream, followed by a snack, and then followed with a warm sandwich and a muffin prior to landing - very impressed. After this experience I will be choosing AA for all my future transatlantic travel out of PHL.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,PHL to ATH,August 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,Recommendedyes

However, on a recent flight with American Airlines back from New York we landed at Chicago O'Hare Airport on a bright, sunny Sunday afternoon only to learn that our 11.20 am flight back into Cedar Rapids had been cancelled. When we went to rebooking, we quickly learned there were no available seats to CID until the next day at 10.00 am. Now this is where the frustration kicks in. Rebooking told us to find a gate agent, they would be able to help. We found a gate agent and asked for help. She educated us that rebooking should have sent us to the main ticket desk. So, we went back out through security to the main ticket counter. There we were told we would not receive any compensation for rental car, or hotel. Clearly this was not a weather related issue.

Worth noting though is the nice lady who allowed us to board and checked in our four bags, when the other lady was wasting our time and refusing to even check us in.

As a result I was delayed in Philadelphia for two hours, then held on the runway at Chicago for an hour, which caused me to just miss my connecting flight from Chicago to Oklahoma City. When we finally did arrive at the gate in Chicago, there was no one there to assist me in getting another flight, despite the fact that the delay was due to their decisions and also despite the fact that I was supposed to have wheelchair service at all stops. I also did not have wheelchair service at Philadelphia like I was supposed to. I am disabled and I ended up having to walk the Chicago O'Hare concourse to a different gate I was directed to, only to be told at that gate that they could not help me and I would need to use the rebooking phone to book the remainder of my flight home myself. To top it off, the rebooking phone agent was not able to assist me with hotel or food vouchers, or with information about my bags. For that, I had to stand in the domestic ticketing line for two hours, then I was issued a hotel voucher that ended up being worthless because too many vouchers were issued for that hotel, and they were full.

Due to a death in the family, I was trying to fly my wife in to attend the funeral. The day of her flight, we got 5 departure time updates in 30 minutes, the last of which pushing up the departure time an hour and thirty minutes from the original posted time. Because we were traveling over that just to get to the airport, although I sped, ran red lights, etc, they would not allow her on the plane even though it was still connected to the airbridge and she missed that flight. Although they were ""willing to work with us"" (if that's what you want to call it), their make up flight for her wasn't supposed to leave until the next day, it was taking her to an airport 2.5 hours north of where she needed to be, and it wasn't even going to arrive until after the funeral. After some back and forth between myself and the ticket counter, I worked out a deal where she would fly from Wilmington, NC to Charlotte, NC, stay the night, and then depart on a United Airlines flight from Charlotte, NC to Dallas and stay on United Airlines from Dallas to her final destination. Well, at 0645 this morning, my wife calls to inform me that although American Airlines printed her a boarding pass with a seat number and everything, they failed to fund the flight change from American to United, so she will now not be allowed on that flight either. Their final fix to the problem is to now send her from Charlotte to Atlanta to Dallas to her final destination all on American Airlines. Her flight won't get in until 2 hours after the funeral, but I guess I should just be happy she's going to get to go home at this point (assuming they don't screw this up too, of which I'm not confident). I dread to see how bad they're going to screw us on the return trip. Their coordination, communication, and customer support is hands down the worst I've ever encountered. Everyone we've dealt with so far (around 7 individuals) have all given us attitude and been unwilling to put in a little leg work to fix the problem that their airline created in the first place.

If I could give advice to any new traveler, avoid American Airlines at all costs.

He made up about half an hour and the passengers ignored his request, taking us over 15 miutes to exit from row 30, giving us about 10 minutes to run from 16B to 269A. As an 83 year old man with an 81 year old lady, it is a wonder that we did not have a heart attack as the temp was 95 degrees. We reached A24 in time to meet a family of 4 who were walking back and informed us that they had shut the gate and would not wait. This was for flight AA734. They said they had been told to go to ""customer service"", a very long walk back. Here we were dealt with by the worlds worst and slowest typist. She proceeded to produce boarding passes for 2 of us and the 4 other passengers. She printed out 8 boarding passes, stared at each one and then threw them in the trash. She then produced 2 more, 1 at each side of the plane, I gave them back and she eventually gave me 2 for row 30. The other party asked for 4 seats together, not near a toilet, so they were eventually given 4 seats next to the toilets for the next day. This operation took her well over an hour, she then told us to go outside where a mini bus would take us to a ""hotel"". The 11 seater mini bus arrived with 7 passengers already on board and asked us to climb in, I sat on the edge of a seat with my foot in the door well and my lady companion sat on the spare wheel. We were then taken 25 miles to the ""Hotel"" which turned out to be a motel. By this time we were all very hungry as we had not eaten for about 10 hours only to be told that there would be no food until breakfast the next day. At this point I asked if I could make a phone call as there would be a taxi waiting for me in Manchester. Surprise, surprise the young man in reception informed me that they did not have a phone, I said they must be the only ""hotel"" in the world without a phone. He said they did not have an outside line. and there was no mobile network. As the taxi arrived in Manchester and waited 2 hours and returned home empty I have had to pay £125 instead of the £55 which I should have paid on the correct day. The next morning we were told that the only trip back to the airport was at 10.30 am so the 13 passengers again crammed into the 11 seater mini bus and we were taken back to the airport to catch our flight at 8.55 pm, after a half hour trip back we then had to wait in the airport we had to wait for aprox. 10 hours. I have travelled the world since I was 18 years old, have been delayed for 24 hours on three accasions but have never felt the need to complain before, but this experience was the most chaotic of my life so far.

When we arrived at our seats, the overhead bins were crammed full half way down the aircraft. In fact, the bin over our seats was occupied by an out of uniform LAX based flight attendant seated in the back of the aircraft! I placed my bag in the first available space, and struggled to get back up the aisle to my seat. My partner had a small, soft-sided bag, and we placed it under the last row of first class seats, in front of the bulkhead, a very secure location. The flight attendants completed their pre take off checks, and never mentioned a problem with the location of the carry on bag. Prior to landing, a crew member walked through the cabin, spotted the bag under the first class seat, and went ballistic at us. She shouted that it was against FAA policy to have a bag in that location. We said, ""fine, no problem, we're happy for you to move it."" She snatched the bag, put it in a first class bin, came back, and proceeded to scold us like naughty children, shouting, again, that it was against FAA policy to have a bag in that location, and told us that ""we had better put it in am overhead bin next time!"" She stormed off, and I was shaking with anger. Since I had to wait after landing to retrieve my bag from the back, I decided I would wait until all of the customers were off the aircraft so I could get her name. I approached her and asked for her name, which she refused to provide. When we both attempted to discuss why we were so disgusted with her behaviour, she threw up her hands in the air, stepped back, and said ""OK, now I feel like your ganging up on me!"" and she walked away. We were totally calm and rational, she was freaking out. She came back and again told us twice about FAA regulations, and walked away, This is how American deals with customer complaints, they claim that they are feeling ""threatened"" so they don't have to address the issue.

We literally watched them put our luggage on the plane as they slammed the door in our face and said sorry it's to late and left us stranded in Phoenix with 2 young kids without our luggage. Thank god for Southwest, we were able to buy tickets to get home the same day. All they offered after we contacted their customer service was a voucher for future flights, no refund for the flight they failed to let us board. So this experience was just as horrific! Except worse! Our departure from Sacramento was scheduled for early morning so we decided to stay at a hotel to be closer and allow us extra time. When we arrived they informed us the plane had hit a bird while landing which I completely understand is out of their control. The way they handled things were where the disaster began. There was clearly no sense of urgency from the ground crew to inspect or repair anything, no repairs were needed. None the less delayed for 2 hours made our connection to Flagstaff impossible. When we asked to get on the next flight we were informed by another non-caring American Airlines employee that the rest of the flights for the day were full so they could only get us there the next morning.

The connecting flight to AUS was scheduled for 1400 CT, but was delayed for an hour and a half (AA1474). The delays continued as the ticket counter informed us repeatedly that we had an aircraft but we had no crew to fly it. After delaying multiple times and moving gates three times (anyone who's flown through ORD knows how awful that is), we were finally informed that our crew had landed and were preparing to run their security checks in the aircraft. At this point, we were lined up and ready to board at 1900 CT - over 7 hours delayed because of crew issues. Out of nowhere, the counter announced the flight was cancelled but would give us no information whatsoever. The agents were rude and dismissive, only giving us re-booking numbers. Because of their ridiculous delays (how the largest US carrier doesn't have pilots on standby in one of the world's busiest airports is beyond me), there were no flights out of ORD that would get me into Austin in time for the memorial the following day. Because there was no point to travel to Austin, I requested to return home and have my money refunded to me (a fair request considering I would miss my event and I spent an entire day in ORD because their incompetence.).

I work in private aviation with access to FAA databases, and everything noted about the flight involves crew issues. There were even other aircraft flying at that same time from ORD to other Texas locations (DFW was a flight I attempted to fly on but was full). AA changed the cancellation reason because they aren't financially responsible to refund airfare and/or offer hotel vouchers. I even requested a food voucher at 2100 CT, and they refused that because my original flight was cancelled for weather. I have sent them multiple requests for a refund, but they refuse. They haven't even offered a phone number to contact their customer relations dept, as they only contact customers through an un-returnable email.

I recently traveled overseas from Philadelphia to Athens with my family. Firstly, I expected anyone with children to be among the first to be boarded. I was, I believe the only one with a 9 month old baby in addition to my 3 1/2 year old toddler. To my surprise, and I'm sure the other parents, we never heard a ""anyone with young children, please feel free to board"" call. Secondly, I was extremely aggravated and angered that I couldn't get the bassinet and seat that goes with it for my baby and I. I called American Airlines weeks before and even 24 hours before my flight, not to mention my Travel Agent who requested that seat for me when they booked my tickets, and was told that ""we don't reserve the bassinet; it's first come, first served"". I can appreciate that and even understand that. What I can't understand is when I arrive at the gate to get it I am told that ""a bassinet is available however the seats have been taken by some people who requested the extra leg room"".  I guess American Airlines is fine with giving a seat to someone for extra leg room over a baby who needs a bassinet to sleep in?

A bit of a mixed bag to be honest. For $430 CAD extra, I was able to upgrade from Economy to Business for the shorter legs and First Class to/from Phoenix. Unfortunately, a month before departure the Toronto to Chicago leg was changed to a smaller aircraft with no business class. No apology or compensation and not even a free alcoholic drink on the plane. Easy check-in, slow security (as always - Pearson being possibly the worst airport for security lines in N America) and an ok lounge with one free drink. Late boarding and departing on a small canadian regional jet with possibly the most disinterested crew member ever. He was just not interested, barely raised a smile, clearly bored and did the minimum required. On time arrival into O'Hare and on time boarding and departure on an A321 to Phoenix. Seat was ok, IFE on my ipad was average but no free wifi (hardly first class service). Slow service on boarding with a long wait for a drink. After departure, hot towel, menu, drink and meal service with wine. Poor quality dinner of steak (overcooked) and gloopy polenta) There was no bread available due to it not being loaded (on a sunday). Surely operating an airline is a 7 day a week business. The saving grace was the Purser who served the cabin well but by herself (and therefore slow). A second drink was offered and service was generally good. The A321 return trip to Charlotte was similar, an ok lounge at Phoenix with some good snacks and a free drink, on time departure, but again slow service on boarding. The meal bizarrely was a salad to start following by a prawn salad with plenty of booze. Again, the purser provided singular but excellent service to the cabin and was omni present and friendly. Charlotte to Toronto was with Eagle on an E175 which on time. Surly crew who offered snacks and one drink. (A second was given on request). Interestingly for me, other experiences with another major US carrier had excellent crew on the farmed out flights to sub contractors, and awful mainline service. With American it was the reverse - much better service with the mainline crew on the A321 and poor and miserable service on the feeder carriers. Was it worth the $430 return for the upgrade (at the time of booking) - just about.

We then stopped and sat in place for 15 minutes and eventually returned to gate before sitting another 20 minutes. we were then told there were computer related issues and maintenance needed to be called. Apparently maintenance isn't stationed at the airport and was 30 minutes out. We were asked to deboard and wait and see. I had a 4.20 connector flight in Charlotte that was missed. The AA employees would not reschedule connections until they knew the status of the current flight. At 2.30 I received a call from AA with a new 6.20 connection time. Still no word on the current flight. At 3.00 we were told plane was fixed and reboarded. 30 minutes later we were still sitting at the gate. We were then told Charlotte airspace was closed and we needed to wait for reroute. We finally backed from gate at 3.40 and given permission to fly. At 3.50 we were then ""grounded"" for supposed weather. We sat on runway for another 30 minutes, and finally took off at 4.20. While on plane I asked the stewardess about making the 6.20 connection flight and was told she had no idea and couldn't find anything out. We landed in Charlotte at exactly 6.04. We landed at B gate. My connection was in E concourse. I sprinted the 1/2 mile to the gate and arrived at 6.15 for 6:20 flight. Plane was still there, doors still open. I was told I couldn't get on plane. I explained my flight was delayed 3 hours. I was rudely told I couldn't get on the plane and told to ""go around corner to reschedule"". I arrived at desk at 6.24 to rebook my connection. The attendant looked at his watch and asked why I didn't get on this plane. The next flight out was 5 hours later. I ended up requesting to fly to another airport having my husband drive 2 hours to pick me up. Flight home July 4: No problem from Myrtle Beach to Charlotte. Flight out of Charlotte scheduled for 8.20 pm to Hartford. Walked to gate to confirm location. Went to eat and came back to get to find gate was moved back to D concourse. Time also delayed 30 minutes. Time kept getting pushed back. A plane arrived and deboarded and were told we had to wait for service. At 9.00 we were told the plane was not cleared to fly. After 15 minutes we were sent back to B concourse. Boareded a plane there and again sat on plane for 30 minutes at gate awaiting who knows what. Ultimately took off 1.5 hours late. Overall poor customer service, significant delays, and no consideration for passengers who spent a lot of money to fly there airline. I will go back to JetBlue or Southwest for half the price and never experienced a problem with them. You lost this customer for good AA.

The bathroom showed a lot of use, with lots of tape and old tape remnants holding in place the toilet. Zero amenities in there, too. There were several lotions in a Cole Hann travel kit by your seat, but not one disposable razor nor shave cream nor comb. Dining was similar. Large portions, but bean counters were again counting.

Stag's Leap is the Chardonnay and one of the reds is Montepulciano d'Abruzzo (not to be confused with the fine reds from Montepulciano in Tuscany). Service was spotty. My wife and I were together but I seemed to get dinner service about 10 minutes before her. And collecting headsets an hour before landing only accommodates the crew. There's nothing wrong with all this, since it is serviceable, just like economy motels. But if you're paying for something special, is it too much to expect something special? And if airlines are competing for higher-priced international travel, could American just loosen its purse-strings by, say, $99 a passenger in first class? It might make a real difference.

","""a very unpleasant flight""",Fred Mertz,United States,24th June 2016,,"American uses dubious business practices when booking tickets. I booked tickets for a family of 4 weeks before the flight date. There were no available seats at the time except for the upgraded seats at premium prices. I checked daily for a month and no seats opened. I hoped to get seats when we got to the airport. When I checked in online 24 hours pre-flight, I checked seats again. Surprisingly there were 42 empty aisles and window seats now available. American wanted to sell out the middle seats first, then make you pay extra for an upgraded seat rather than make all the empty seats available. We got 2 aisle seats and 2 window seats in the same row. The plane was extremely small and the seats were closer together with less legroom than any of the other 7 carriers I've flown domestically this year - by a lot. When the seat in front of me reclined I had no room to read my iPad without propping it on the top of the seatback in front of me. This made for a very unpleasant flight. Further - all the cabin overhead lights were turned off for the entire flight. It was a red eye but there was no option to turn a light on if you wanted to. Whenever a passenger opened a window blind they were told by the flight crew to close it. This was supposedly to allow people to sleep (because nobody sleeps on day flights obviously) but in effect it minimized the work the cabin crew had to do since everyone was relegated to darkness and had little reason to ask for anything from them. The worst airline and the worst flight I've ever taken is an impressive one-two punch. Avoid American at all costs.

About three weeks later, we get an email saying that our flight has been changed to leave three hours and a half hours earlier, creating a 4 hour layover in Dallas before heading to our real destination of Cozumel. They also changed our return flight to arrive at a completely different airport on the opposite side of the city (about an hour away). This flight also included more layover time. I tried to check in online the night before our flight and checked my bags. I wanted to make sure that we could get in and on the plane quickly and easily. This is the best way to travel through any other airlines I've been on. Not so with American Airlines. It was upon checking in and checking my bags and feeling this great relief that a few minutes later I get the dreaded email - they changed our flight again, just hours before our flight. This time they added another 2 hours layover in Dallas making it a 6 hour layover and it's leaving two hours earlier. We were already booked on a dawn flight. Please keep in mind that flying directly to Cozumel from Houston is only 2 hours total. Since we are flying this airline, we are flying first to a more northern location to wait more than half a day and then back south to our final destination. We arrive at the airport without any sleep because they didn't tell us until 9 pm that they were changing our flight to 5:10 AM. The airport is an hour from our house and this is an international flight, so we had to leave our house by 2 am to get there on time for customs. We actually decided to leave even earlier since we couldn't sleep anyway and got to the airport by 2:30 AM. This is two hours and forty minutes before our flight and there is no one at the ticketing booth. In fact, they had a long line and all the passengers were worried about missing their flights. No one came to the booth until just past 3 am and still took on average 25 minutes for each group of travelers. We didn't get to security until about 50 minutes before our flight and they almost didn't let us on. In fact, one of the security ladies chewed me out because I was feeling antsy and worried about making my flight. She barked that I should have gotten to to the airport well before my flight. I was. It was American Airlines fault for not being at their ticketing booth on time, nor having enough agents to check in their passengers. They are the ones who moved our flight to the middle of the night without our permission, and without any options to change this. It's not our fault they don't have staff to deal with these changes they inflict on their clients.  I am actually on the plane and I am going to try to move past how upsetting this whole experience is and that I will waste a full day of my vacation without any sleep and stuck in an airport north of my destination and departing city. The only thing that gives me peace of mind in all of this is that there are other options/airlines in the future because I will never fly with them again after my return flight, which I pray they don't screw up too. We leave tomorrow afternoon for home on this airline. All of this and they charged us baggage fees when I originally checked in online and then charged again when we checked in at the airport because American Airlines had to modify our return flight.

","""where was the notification?""",Rich Pagliaro,United States,3rd June 2016,,"Back in January, I booked a direct flight from JAX (Jacksonville, FL) to ORD (O'Hare-Chicago, IL) through Expedia. My family and I were returning home from my niece's graduation and my son had school the following day. The flight number was 4266 and it was scheduled to leave JAX at 5.20pm and arrive at ORD at 7.09pm. About a month later Expedia called and stated that American had dropped that flight and we would need to reschedule. The only available flights that would get us home at a decent hour was to go from JAX to CLT (Charlotte, NC) at 4.54pm-6.15pm and then CLT to ORD at 7.05-9.14pm. Certainly not what I wanted, but better than nothing. This was all for a flight on May 23rd, 2016. We arrived at the airport about 2.30pm and proceeded to our gate. So much for the long security line. Sometime after that, we received an alert from Expedia that our flight was delayed by 30 minutes. About 5 minutes later, Expedia alerted us that our flight was now an hour late. Still nothing from American even though they had my email, phone number and I had the American Airline app on my phone all setup for alerts. About 5 minutes after the second Expedia alert American finally sent an alert via phone call that our flight was 30 minutes late. That was the only notice we received from American outside of the announcements at the gate that did not start until later. I knew we would miss our connecting flight so I went to the gate to inquire about a later flight from CLT to ORD. I was informed that they automatically pushed us back to the 10.35 flight from CLT to ORD. Nice to have a seat but where was the notification? Not to mention that the flight was not schedule to land at ORD until 11.44pm. A little late for my son to be out on a school night. I was also told by the person working the gate that my original direct flight was being put back on the schedule in June. Very nice of her to point that out, especially when it didn't help me at the time. Or maybe I could have just stayed at the airport another few weeks. Our flight out of JAX ended up 2 1/2 hours late giving us enough time to get to the gate in CLT with about 15 minutes to spare. Thank goodness we had carry-ons only. Our flight to ORD was slightly delayed but not too bad. The flight attendant forgot to offer my wife and I our complimentary beverage during service. I had to ask her for a drink and she seemed put off that I did so. I called customer service to complain as I had paid a premium originally for a direct flight, was bumped to a cheaper flight and was now bumped again to an even cheaper flight. They said they could not help me and I needed to send an email to customer relations. So I did explaining exactly what happened and how I was now also going to need to spend money on a meal at the airport that I did not plan to do. And we all know those are not cheap. American Airlines response to me was that services were provided. I will never fly American again and will never recommend them.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,JAX to ORD via CLT,May 2016,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1,Recommendedno

From there, however, we were delayed another two hours waiting on fuel and gate accessibility and just general disorder in an airport clearly ill equipped to deal with the diversion. By the time we made it back to Charlotte, there were too many planes there to get anyone who was even close to making their connection into the airport - at this point what was meant to be a 2 hour flight had taken 5.5 hours. Stood in a never-ending line waiting for rude customer service and spent the night sleeping on Reagan-era chairs. The next morning we were treated like second class citizens, shuttled from gate to gate waiting on standby flights like we were looking for a handout and hadn't paid a hefty price to book in the first place. It's one thing to have weather impact the flight experience; that's no one's fault.

Drinks, including beer and wine were complimentary. Unfortunately all they had for beer was Budweiser but what else can you expect from AA? This was a good crew. No fake smiles - they were just regular people treating me like a regular person. Efficient, and I felt completely safe with them. Entertainment was great.

This time I had to opt out with flying American Airlines on the way back to Seattle from Philadelphia and it was the worst travel experience I have had in years. In Philadelphia: the flight was overbooked. The plane was old, but my seats were okay because I paid extra for preferred seats and sat in the front area. Once onboard, it turned out that there was an issue with their A/C. At first we were told it would take a ""few minutes"", 15-20 min later, this was extended to ""30 min, at best"". After over an hour we were told this may take up to 2 hours and another 10 mins later finally asked to deplane. I had a connecting flight in Chicago following a layover of just over 2 hours - which meant that the connection was no more. After talking to the gate agent I was put on a new connection, from Philly to Charlotte and then to Seattle. Of course, my careful seat selection that I did during booking was gone. The plane I then got onto was old, seats old and cramped so tightly together I couldn't even sit straight. I could not reach anywhere once the table was unfolded. I sat in the very back, center seat, all of which was the opposite of what I had paid money for so that I would not have to endure it. Suffice to say: this flight again was delayed, over half an hour. Finally in Charlotte, off to the next flight: pretty much the same thing, except that this one at least had wifi. However, since American Airlines does like to overbook their flights they now collected my carry on because all overheads were full, although I told them I was already late and needed to run once we arrived in Seattle. To no avail, customers needs don't matter. And of course it left delayed. We landed at 8.42 and the baggage claim carousel started running at 9.21 - nearly 40 minutes.

The entire crew felt like they were being put out of their way in all their duties. It was a 5 hour plus flight and there was not even a small bag of chips provided. The inservice video was not working from my seat with nothing that could be done. On the return flight a week later, another lazy crew was on board. At one point I went to use the lavatory at the rear of the plane and both crew members were sitting in their seats in the last row of the plane talking. In front of the galley was a mother and young daughter who were being shouted at by one of the crew because they had helped themselves to something in the galley.

I found the flight crew to be indifferent, the service below average and the attitude seemed to be we were a constant inconvenience preventing them from being able to get back to the socializing at the front of the cabin. I am a very, very low maintenance flyer, but I found even the basics were missed. On the outbound leg, I wasn't even offered a drink at boarding! This is in International First Class. Food choices weren't available from the menu (I was in 2J) and I get the distinct impression that most people on the flight were on FF upgrades as opposed to paying pax.

My first flight to Miami landed on time at 9 pm, by the time I was actually off the plane (I pack very light and had one small backpack) it was about 9:07. I ran to my connecting flights gate to make sure I got there in time to check in and board to return home. When I approached the gate (at 9:15), the gate worker asked aloud if anyone was next and after I said that I was on the flight he responded very rudely ""too late, go rebook at the rebooking station"" and as he said that he printed out a boarding pass and handed it to a girl who was on stand by with her boy friend, also on stand by. So he basically did not want to undo what he had just done, which was give my seat away when I got there when I was supposed to be. The lady at the rebooking station then tried to charge me to rebook for something that was not my fault! I was stuck in Miami for over 12 hours, missed my shift at work and my classes.

At that time we decided to continue to wait in line to speak with the check-in staff.

I did not say a single word or interrupt. She looked up at me and said in the most rude condescending disrespectful tone, that they weren’t ready. So I said back, “excuse me I didn’t even say anything to you”. Four other staff members who were free proceeded to talk and chat amongst each other.

The only entertainment was CRT screens in the middle aisles and a choice of music played in a loop from the arm rest, maybe this was acceptable 10 years ago but in 2016 you would expect the airline to provide a modern cabin. In fact the whole cabin was so old and tatty even those in first had to use tablets for entertainment, this is unacceptable when paying passengers expect some modernisation. For such a popular route from Chicago to London you would expect American Airlines to consider using a more modern aircraft, but no they obviously don't care what their customers might think of the airline. They can afford to buy dremaliners and 777's but don't bother updating their current fleet. The food was also pretty poor quality compared wo what I have been offered on BA in the past, but I don't expect fine dining on an economy ticket.

Due to leave Ontario, CA at 1005 am arriving PHX at 1114 am. When I checked in at 0800 flight was “on time.” Cleared security and proceeded to the departure gate. Around 0935 announcement made that flight was delayed and passengers with connecting flight prior to 1230 were to return to ticketing counter. My Atlanta connection was scheduled for 1236 so I stayed at the gate. A second announcement was made some time later and I realized there was no way I could make my connecting flight. There is no customer service available at the gate areas and I had to return to the ticketing counter which meant a second time through security. This certainly did not please me but I went back to the ticketing counter and stood in the line that provided ticket sales/customer service. During my 30 minute wait in line the clerk kept telling the customers they would be much quicker going to the other end of the counter. Finally, when the “other end of the counter” was free I moved over to it. The clerk told me she couldn’t help me and directed me back to the counter I had just moved from. I told her it was time American Airlines got their act together as “he” had just directed me to her counter for service. By then I was incensed but, moved back to the other line yet again. At no time did I hear any explanation for the two delays. By the time I got to the clerk I was not too receptive to her “resolutions.” She could reschedule me for the following day (I had already cleared my hotel and turned in my car); she could route me to Dallas/Ft Worth, Charlotte, Atlanta; she could route me to Dallas/Ft Worth, Atlanta. Both flights would get me to Atlanta around 1148 pm. I did ask about transferring to either Southwest or Delta but was told I could only transfer to “partner” airlines. If I wanted to go with another airline I would have to pay to do so. At that time I had no idea there was a bad storm impacting Dallas but I’m sure your staff were well aware of that fact. While not happy, I opted for the Dallas/Ft Worth, Atlanta flight. Went back through security for a second time and headed for the departure gate. Another announcement stated due to a bad storm in the Dallas area the flight was delayed. This delay meant I would miss the last shuttle from Atlanta. The coup de gras was my boarding passes were stamped for Group 4-----my seat numbers were 23A and 15C. I came to the conclusion that your clerk purposely placed me in the Group 4 boarding sequence to add a little more aggravation----retribution perhaps? I’m 78 years old and have traveled many, many times in the past 58 years both in the States and to other countries. The airlines have merged to the point that they now have a monopoly. Subsequently, they no longer have to be concerned about retaining their customers. They are making billions in profits with the fuel price as low as they are but you continue to gouge the customers at every point - $25 for early boarding, really?

Flight was fully booked. All overhead storage was full, well before half the plane boarded. Our boarding group wasn't even called yet before they announced storage was full. This did cause boarding to take a lot longer than normal, as many people had to back track to check their bag with the front desk. The front desk continuously announced you could check your bag for free at the desk, due to the storage shortage, but it appeared most who were boarding ignored this. We gladly took them up on it, and dropped off our bags at the desk, well before everyone else finally realized they had no choice.

We flew economy, so seats were as expected. I'm quite tall, as is my wife, so it can be a bit uncomfortable with the small leg room after an hour or two.

Our flight was oversold, and when they could not find enough people to take their vouchers, they announced a last minute delay. They didn’t follow any procedures for said delay. Their gate agents knew nothing and the flight information wasn’t updated until sometime after I had boarded. Once onboard, we were told the delay was due to a leaky coffee pot. I’m still at a loss as to what safety issues were at stake for this issue. The flight attendant wasn’t much better simply stating, ‘you wouldn’t water on the floor would you?’ Clearly there is a disconnect here, because missing a connecting flight over a little or even potentially a lot of water on the floor isn’t worth it, especially on a holiday weekend where my plans for the following day ended up completely ruined.  Myself and probably a dozen other people missed our connecting flights. In my case, I arrived at my gate just as my plane was pushing off. My destination wasn’t a hub, and the people managing this flight couldn’t wait five more minutes to allow myself and the other two passengers who arrived at the same time I did, the courtesy to board. The next flight was four hours later (on a red-eye), and for my inconvenience, I got a meal voucher that would only be able to pay for a fast food dinner. Running through Phoenix, my laptop bag managed to open up causing my laptop to fall out. My experience with AA customer service wasn’t much better. They don’t get back right away, and they refused to escalate this. To this day, I’m still trying to figure out how a leaky coffee pot presents any real safety issue worthy of grounding a flight, and customer service didn’t have a good reason for it either. I was offered a measly 10,000 bonus miles, worth nowhere near what the travel voucher I should have received for essentially being involuntarily bumped. That will get you (if you’re lucky) one third of a domestic ticket, and not at all worth the inconvenience that was forced on me and fellow passengers. At best, this was someone’s incompetence.

Pre-flight drinks offered and the menu given out. Considering AA now only has eight seats in the 1st class compartment of the Boeing 777-300, the two cabin staff assigned were more than sufficient; friendly and polite despite the harried nature of the boarding. Lunch served after reaching cruising altitude, starter, soup, and salad were very good. I wasn't very happy with the main course, considering the delay I probably should have chosen something other than beef. The flight attendant saw that I hadn't eaten anything she offered me another which was delicious. The inflight entertainment was great with hundreds of choices. The intercontinental WiFi took some adjusting but eventually worked just fine. My connecting flight was delayed for about an hour due to a mechanical part which needed replacing. Again on the short flight to St. Louis the cabin crew was friendly and very helpful with pre-flight offered immediately. Drinks were served promptly at cruising altitude and seconds were offered with a smile. Aside from the weather delay, not a bad experience at all.

While the AA planes were shiny and new and the business class was very comfortable, the level of service between the two carriers was night and day.

On Cathay I was personally greeted, asked if I required anything before takeover (and prior to landing), was given a large, clean, hot towel, had a very attentive flight crew that cared about my comfort and was always there to help and offer anything. On American Airlines I had a crew of people that clearly wanted to be anywhere else.  The warm towel was old and cold, the food was thrown at me as if it was a race to finish the meal service, when I asked for another water I was given the cold stare - the team just seemed mad and visibly demonstrated that they think their job sucks.

I was scheduled to depart from Fayetteville, NC with American Airlines - I asked the lady working at the front ticket counter if there were possibly any flights I could make out of Raleigh, which is an hour away. She pretended to look then said there was absolutely nothing and I was stuck with the next day flight. A little while after leaving I decided to call customer service just to be sure, as it turns out there was a flight at 07.30 from Raleigh that I could have made it on to, and been able to make it back home for my college courses. Along with that there were also about 6 other flights available that day out of Raleigh. Even though the lady on the phone wasn't friendly at least she was patient and helpful. Sadly this isn't the end of my story, I ended up having a connection flight home, of course my first flight out of Raleigh was delayed so I had to run to the next gate.

Both outbound and inbound flights with American Airlines were problematic to put it discretely. Outbound from Albuquerque (ABQ) to LA we waited on the tarmac for nearly an hour for what was explained as ""too much weight"". This enlarged into needing to correct the paperwork for this weight problem and finally into having to burn off fuel to eliminate the extra weight. Overall confusing and seeming disorganized in the first place. Our last leg through Phoenix to ABQ was a true mess. We came in on an overnight flight from Honolulu with a connecting flight leaving at app. 9am for Abq. However, we were held in Phoenix until 2pm due to ""mechanical problems"" with our assigned plane. This plane was still in Austin, (or so the gate staff said but the Customer service staff office nearby said it had departed earlier). As we sat and waited one could hear constant AA gate changes followed by a rush of passengers to elsewhere. The question steaming through our passenger group was simply, is there not another aircraft available when such a thing happens? Will we need to hustle to squeeze on to the next scheduled fight to Abq? Shall we rent a car and drive? The stressed gate staff kept announcing new and later departure times with no other info available. Then suddenly (our) plane arrived and after waiting briefly for a co pilot we left app. 5 hours late. The impression left was one of being in a gritty country called AA where chaos, lack of information and customer service is casually routine and where shareholders and yet greater profits are really the primary goal.

The space, comfort, and privacy on this aircraft is second to none. The cabin crew were courteous and helpful (most of my flights with AA have been in coach where the rudeness of the staff used to be legendary). On both flights, the FA greeted by name, confirmed my meal order with me (requested on line) and took my coat. Outbound lunch was good, as were the wines. Drinks constantly replenished. A selection of snacks was laid out in the bar between meals, although I didn’t try them. The pre-landing snack was croque monsieur, which was ok but really no better than the pizza that you used to get in coach many years ago. Before landing, the purser walked through the cabin thanking each passenger for flying AA. A nice touch. Bose noise cancelling headphones are superb, although they collect them almost an hour before landing. On the return from MIA, the food and service were again very good. The steak on flights starting the in the US is always better than on those starting in the UK, and it was served on a very hot plate. The salad was excellent. FA asked if I wanted to be woken for breakfast. Although I didn’t I was awake when breakfast came round and it was surprisingly good. I’d previously flown Business Class on the US Airways A330. The 777-300 seat is similar but improved. There is no gap between the seat and the wall, where things can be lost on the A330. There is a vanity mirror in the storage cupboard. The TV screens are larger (15”). The seats have more adjustable positions. However, there is no storage under the footrest. A nice lightweight duvet and large fluffy pillow added to the comfort. The seats are a bit hard when sitting fully upright or fully flat for any length of time, but are very comfortable when reclined. Sleeping on the way back, the plane was very warm and I slept on top of the duvet which was very comfortable indeed. The washrooms on this plane are very nice, particularly the one on the starboard size which is double sized. The equipment makes this Boeing 777-300 the best business class across the Atlantic, and the service was up to par. The downside of this plane is that all the seats are very private, and if you are travelling with a companion then even in the middle pair you can’t really see or talk to each other. If you want to socialise with a travelling companion, you may not like this plane.  IFE was fair, not a lot of new films but enough newish and classics to keep me happy.

Even then there's an expectation that you'll have to tip the barman who provides it. Otherwise, it's a few cheese crackers, cheese cubes and assorted nuts.

There was a very long and unexplained wait after boarding until the doors were closed, and a further wait until pushback. You'd think that the flight attendants would be thinking ahead to how they'd be able to get on with service quicker on a night flight, such as taking dinner and drinks orders, but no, all standing around in the galley chatting. After take-off the flight attendants got out of their seats after 30 minutes. The next step was to manually log out 30 entertainment tablets and noise-cancelling earphones, so that was another 30 minutes gone. It was 90 minutes from take-off before the first drink hit the table. Dinner orders were then taken, and the meal service got under way. The cabin was kept at full illumination, with no attempt to create any form of night-time ambience. The starter was a mushroom carpaccio, which was very tasty, followed by what you'd think would a safe option 'steak in demi-glaze of blue-cheese'. The demi-glaze looked like oatmeal, and the steak was bloody in the middle, so after a few cuts, the blood started running everywhere, and it quickly became a pink, inedible mess. The dessert was ice-cream, which took a full 15 minutes before you could even crack off a chip with a spoon.

Check-in and bag-drop took seconds and the lounge was quiet and fairly empty first thing in the day. I chose this flight as it was the newly-configured business cabin on the Boeing 767-300. Overall impression very good, seemed spacious and every seat is an aisle seat, which is a huge plus. I had a window seat, and it actually was a window seat - rather other airlines where you sit at an angle and have to twist to look out. The seat had a large fixed table area between the seat and the aisle, so there was no possibility of being knocked by someone on their way past. Like all new products there were a few design issues. You have to be more or less upright before you can release and then raise the table, but you get the hang of it eventually. The seat controls are very sensitive and you can often accidentally move your seat if you arm is laying where it normally would. The meal service was good, pre-ordered main course was there, and it seemed a very honest product. A very cheap appetiser, just humous, olives and pitta bread but then a delicious fish main course, with a choice of dessert and cheese. You had to wait for the entertainment system to be distributed after take-off, in the form of content loaded tablets and noise-reducing headphones. The 767's were always noisy old crates, but if you take along your own headphones and entertainment, there's no need to wait for theirs (although there is a huge choice of material). The seat was one of the most comfortable I've sat in for ages, it moved around easily, and in combination with a built in footstool, it wans't long before I had found the perfect position and was so comfortable I didn't want to get up.

There were lines at every kiosk and hundreds of people waiting on line throughout. We got on line and waited 40 minutes at a kiosk (several were out of service it seems). Everyone who got a turn at bat eventually arrived a problem which required a customer service person to come over and help them. The help mainly consisted of sending them to the baggage check/kiosk service lines. Our turn was no different. As our baggage tags began to print, the machine had a glitch, indicating that it was probably out of tag stickers. We flagged down a customer rep who - you guessed it - sent us to the baggage check/kiosk service line where we waited another hour plus. Everyone we watched was having to remove stuff from their bags and this was very time consuming. When we got to the front of the line, they weighed our bag (which was the identical bag we had flown in with - nothing added!) and told us it was 2 lbs over and we could remove items or pay a $100 upcharge for the overweight bag. Since by now our flight was boarding and we still had not gone through security, we felt compelled to pay the charge. As we were boarding, our daughter with a smaller bag carry on was forced to check it anyway, as most of the other passengers were also being forced to check.

I fly monthly to weekly for work with multiple airlines. I am flying with American Airlines tomorrow from Madison to Seattle via Chicago. After my travel agent booked my flight I went onto my mobile app to select my seat. All the open seats had an up charge to select them. So, I decided to wait to get a seat assignment at check in. This morning I checked in on my mobile app. I was assigned a seat and given my boarding pass like usual. A few hours later I got on to the seat selection portion of my app. It showed the seat I was in did not recline. It also showed that all the seats except one in the back still had an up charge. So, I picked the seat in the back of the plane. After confirming my seat change I saw that the seat I had been assigned originally was a preferred seat with extra leg room and priority boarding. It also showed that to move back to that seat I was initially assigned I would have to pay an up charge. I decided to call reservations to see if there was anything I could do to keep the same seat level I'd been assigned but switch to one that reclines. This is a 4 hour flight at 5am after all. The rep said she couldn't explain what happened and couldn't help me because I was already signed in. She did say that it shouldn't have happened (all seats shouldn't have up charges and I should've been able to move seats in the cabin I was assigned). So, I decided to call the mobile app technical support line to see if they could at least tell me what happened. The tech person sent me to a supervisor who was supposed to be able to help. The supervisor listened to me explain what happened then proceeded to accuse me of lying because it didn't line up with the activity on my account. She said I would've had to pay for my original seat assignment claiming I hadn't completed my transaction and had I gone to the ""last screen"" I would've been asked for a credit card. I explained that I didn't ever ask for an upgrade and that I merely checked in and did fully check in without ever being asked for a credit card or told I had priority seating. I also told her I had the preferred seat on my boarding pass. She said that had I kept that seat and gone to the airport tomorrow, I would've been told I had to pay $68 or switch to whatever seats were left open at the back of the plane. I told her that sound strange and didn't seem like great customer service. She then asked ""what are doing right now"". I explained I was just looking for an explanation of what happened (was it an issue with my app?) and looking for someone to make me feel like a valued customer. I really wanted to understand what went wrong, I fly too much to deal with this and have never had anything like this happen before. The woman then rather heatedly announced that they are the best airline in the world. I told her our conversation wasn't demonstrating that and that the reason we were talking right now was because I wanted to give them a chance to show me that. I asked if she could just help me understand what happened and confirm the issue wasn't there for the other leg of my flight. She then told me to have a nice day and hung up on me. I was shocked.

When we arrived at the airport there was confusion amongst everyone. We waited for what seemed to be over 2 hours to see an agent. The agents left the economy class to serve priority customers. All three agents served priority. No one was at the counter for economy class. Several customers and I tried to speak with the supervisor, but she refused to speak to us. One gentleman was nice enough to take care of us. We found out that our flight was cancelled. My husband and I had to return home, which cost us $55.00, then catch the next available flight the next evening leaving JFK. This cost us another 65.00. We arrived San Juan at 2am on the 29th. We lost 1 full day, plus one night of our vacation time. On Jan 2, we were assigned to return home. We had two carry on bags because we were not planning on taking the connecting flight. When we were on line to aboard the plane, the young girl said, you will have to check your bags, with no explanation. I said, we can't because we are not taking the connecting flight. She never looked at me. She just repeated, ""you Have to check your bags, you will get them at the gate on the other side!"" When we went onboard there were many empty bins. I asked the steward, why did the young girl at the gate make us check our bags if there are several empty bins. He apologized and said, she should have checked with us first. I have to say I didn't feel safe or supported with most of the staff working for American Airlines. My husband and I felt we were treated very poorly. We've been traveling regularly. We used other carriers and never experienced such unprofessional behavior. ",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,EWR to SJU via CLT,December 2015,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,,1,Recommendedno

The flight from Heathrow arrived 50 minutes late. None of the American Airlines staff made any attempt to assist these two girls in making the connection. They sold them the ticket, so they must have known that they had a connecting flight, yet every enquiry they made they were told to wait. They missed the connection and eventually someone at AA did at least organise them a hotel.

Flight from SFO to DFW departed and landed with no complications. Original leave time for flight #5812 on Sunday was to depart at approximately 8:30, to land in GSO at 11:05. Our troubles began when the gate changed from B47 to B1 with no notice or confirmation. The only reason we found out was from a non-airport flight tracker web site. Waiting at B1 with the rest of the people scheduled to take the flight, our gate was then changed again, back to B47 with no confirmation or notification from the airport. At this time the gate personnel at B1 still had no idea. The only reason we found out, again was from a non-affiliate web site. After running to the gate at the other end of the airport with 5 minutes to spare, (this because the Sky Link was broken) we made it to B47. At B47 there was no Gate attendant, only a message on the screen informing us that the flight would depart at the scheduled time. As we watched the scheduled time come and go, again with no gate attendant in sight the screen changed again with a later departure time, still no gate attendant at this time. After 2 hours a non-related flight attendant traveling with our group answered the ringing phone, to inform the control center that there was no gate attendant, no pilot, no crew, and that the plane had been sitting there since when we first arrived. About 5 minutes later the supervisor showed up. She was unresponsive to anyone’s questions, and refused to talk to anyone. She got on the phone a few times, typed in the computer and we watched the departure time change again. Only this time is was changed to 11:00, which was the same time as another scheduled flight. These people were also now at the gate and as confused as we were (because the airport flight screens said both our flights would be leaving at the same time, from the same gate). We finally got word that we were waiting on a crew, and we watched a pilot and two stewardesses board the plane. Again, no notice from any gate personnel. After we watched the now changed 11:30 departure time come and go, we watched the pilot and two stewardesses deboard the plane. Still no one at our gate to answer any questions, as the supervisor had left hours before. We asked the pilot and stewardesses what was happening and they responded that they had been sitting on the plane for too long, and were now over their hours. They also informed us once they walked away there was no one to fill their spots, and the flight would inevitably be cancelled. Again no notice from the screen that still said it was departing at 11:30, which at this time it was 12:30. I called, and they rebooked us to fly out Monday, from Dallas to Ft.

I have been flying with them several times in the last 5 years so I knew what to expect: basic service, aged planes and lower standards compared to major European and Asian carriers. The B738 which operated the domestic leg was kind of new instead, seats were comfortable and with a big screen (most of the services had to be paid, thoughI did enjoy the map) and crew, including the talkative pilot, nice so nothing to complain about. There was also a medical emergency on the way to Florida and it was managed promptly. MIA to MXP was operated by an old B767-300ER and, as expected, it felt like being on a bus even thought the seat is slightly better in terms of width and softness than on newer planes of any airline. Food was bad but I was prepared and I brought something with me so did not starve, it was a night flight so having no entertainment did not bother me so much but it must be painful on a daylight trip, if you are not aware. Again, crew polite and friendly but very little information from the cockpit and it was not understandable because of the bad intercom system. The only issue was the check in Miami as they force you to use the automatic machines and tag your own luggage but often you end up having to ask for help (i.e. for checking your Passport if you are not an EU citizen, like my girlfriend) and at the end the whole procedure may become slower than the standard one. The real plus of this airline is the price and I have got the feeling they are trying hard to keep their standards up to date by buying a huge number of new planes and by providing their customers a better service but it will probably take some time before they can really compete with non-US carriers in terms of quality. Personally, I will keep flying with them inside US while for overseas flights to/from USA my choice will still be for European carriers, unless unbeatable deals.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to MXP via MIA,December 2015,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,3,Recommendedno

Business class seating is barely appropriate for such a new plane. Private light not working, confusing reclining commands and even worst IFE system with several unexpected resets. Apart from a boring diner and a breakfast which I would recommend anyone to stay away from at any cost, the crew is only performing routinely, smiling and extra pampering optional. It seems that their presence is strictly contained at maintaining the cabin within permissible safety standards, all other tasks being sidelined. The herringbone layout of the cabin for some reason leads to permanent knocking on the back of your head from the passenger seating behind you. Never experiernced this before in any other new business class cabins from other airlines.

We boarded the plane to find a substandard first class cabin. Carry-on bags barely fit into the overhead compartments. There was no lie-flat seating. There wasn't even a pillow! Seriously, on an overnight flight - no pillow in first class? Then we found out there was no food either! American cuts off food service at 10:00 pm, which is ridiculous. We'd just flown overnight with Hawaiian Air the previous night, and they served a full dinner after take-off at 1:30am. Yet American didn't even offer the traditional snack basket. We were doled out a handful of warm nuts, and a cookie. Plan on starving with American. Speaking of no bed and no food, the third ""no"" we encountered was no entertainment. During a 5-hour flight, they didn't even offer tablets. We were totally on our own. The flight attendant did inform us that, if we happened to bring our own tablet, we could purchase movies during the flight. I kid you not - in first class they want you to buy your own entertainment. Then the dingbat flight attendant failed to turn on the cabin lights for the first half hour of the flight, so we couldn't even read our own books. We sat in total darkness twiddling our thumbs. Summing up American Airlines first class cabin on a 5-hour overnight flight, there is: No lie-flat seat No pillow, No food, No snacks, No entertainment, Extended darkness. Apparently American thinks passengers should sleep on an overnight flight, since they provide barely more than a floor for us to ride on. Unfortunately they make sleeping impossible with miserably uncomfortable accommodations. Congratulations American Airlines. You win the grand prize for lousiest first class experience worldwide.

Then, a couple of minutes, from behind me I hear a gruff and bothered female voice; “Do you need something?” I explained that there was a bag in front of me and that I was concerned that someone had left it by mistake.

I purchased a ticket for my Mother to fly from Pittsburgh to Columbia with a stop in Charlotte. This was a 90th birthday surprise party for her. When she arrived at the gate escorted by my niece, she was informed that she could not carry on her luggage. This was because no American Airlines employee would be willing to lift her carry on case to the overhead bin. Her carry on case was within the size required for carry on, however, would not fit under the seat. My 90 year old mother is unable to lift items above her head. My niece was not permitted to enter the cabin of the aircraft to lift the carry on for her. My mother takes a variety on medications and could not risk the chance of losing her luggage in the stowed compartment of the aircraft. After extreme anxiety, my niece was able to purchase a $100 piece of luggage that would fit under the seat and would hold all of her things. Her case was not heavy or even filled. I contacted American Airlines customer service. After a month, American Airlines gave her a $50 flight coupon for her inconvenience. What a joke!

Once the plane arrived at 11:45 they rushed us all onboard and then sat there for 40 minutes on the tarmac.

After a 2 hour delay and 1.5 hours on the plane they finally canceled. But it gets better!

Understandably, my flight was originally delayed two hours due to a passenger being sick. From there, bad weather caused my flight to be detoured and grounded in Kansas for 1+ hours before resuming the flight to Texas. During this entire flight time, we were only served drinks once (at the very beginning of the flight), and the flight was short on food due to the previous delay due to sickness. Therefore us passengers went 7+ hours with only one beverage service, and no available food. When we landed, we were all scrambling to reach our connecting delayed flights, if they hadn't been cancelled at that point yet. Luckily, I reached my gate in time, waited an hour, before realizing people were slowly disappearing even though there had been no announcement stating my flight had been cancelled (this was at 12AM). After inquiring if my flight was in fact cancelled, I was also told that every single flight to my destination was booked the next day with no openings on any flights for over a day. Desperate, I asked how I could get closer to my destination. I was put on standby for a 1:30AM flight out, and told I could take a 2 hour bus ride to my destination in the morning. Once again, upon landing at 2:30 in the morning, we were left unable to unload for one hour because flights were backed up.

My wife and our two toddlers had to get a flight out of San Diego to Salt Lake City via Los Angeles. She got to the airport with plenty of time, but being a Friday evening, the airport was packed. She went to check in at the kiosk, but it denied her and she had to wait in a long line to see a rep. Finally, she got to the front of the line, only to be told that she needed to go wait in another line because the counter she waited for was being closed. With two toddlers, who, thank the lord, were very well-behaved, a carry-on suitcase, and a stroller, she had to get into another line to wait all over again. By this time, her departure was getting close and she had not even gotten her ticket due to the kiosk denying her (for whatever reason) and being sent to wait again in another line. When she finally got to the ticket counter (again) the female rep told my wife that it was a waste of time to print her ticket as my wife and kids would surely miss the flight. There was still time to make the flight, but the time was running out quickly. Having no sense of courtesy, the rep began to close down her counter and handed out cards with a phone number that people would have to call to have their tickets printed. I have never seen or heard of that before.

The airplane was still docked, but the door was closed, thus she was denied boarding. My wife went around to a few different American Airlines desks to figure out what she could do and wasn't helped at all, rather, she was greeted with agitation, not sympathy or civility. Eventually, Alaska Airlines allowed her onto their next flight free of charge, which was a direct flight, and she made it home. However, she had to wait another several hours in the San Diego terminal with two toddlers to get onto that flight. American Airlines and their reps made my wife and two young kids miss their flight and couldn't care less. Alaska Airlines solved our crisis and didn't even charge us.

Since AA continues to pack seats in the plane, even at the back where the width of the fuselage tapers (where I was sitting), the width of the aisle was only barely wide enough to let the service cart through. Seriously, it is beyond belief that AA would just cram extra seats in the back and make people uncomfortable just to make a few extra dollars. As a result, my left elbow was hit almost every time the service cart went by, for the entire flight. So, while trying to sleep, I was bumped awake all night for every transit of the flight attendant and the cart. In addition, our flight attendant was stressed, terse, harried, and rude, from the very first interaction, indicating a lack of either appropriate personnel selection or inadequate training. American Airlines in-flight meal was at best mediocre, and their free alcohol selection abysmal – they offered only beer, or cardboard-boxed wine, far below the selections of other transatlantic airlines, even those that are US-based. We flew Air France home from Lisbon through Paris to Atlanta, and then on to Savannah. Our transatlantic flight featured large, leather, comfortable seats, excellent food, flight attendants, and choice of drinks, so that I know an airline can make money and make passengers happy at the same time. My wife and I paid $1100 for the privilege of enduring this awful, cramped, uncomfortable American Airlines flight, the same price as all the other economy cabin passengers flying further forward. I have sent a letter to American Airlines about this experience and can only hope that they look at the letter seriously and improve their service, seating, and staff. If not, I hope that their current flight standard eventually generates enough negative feedback that passengers choose other carriers and they go out of business. That way their routes and traffic can be taken over by other more passenger-friendly airlines (which are virtually every other one that we have flown).

When I was talking to the representative on the phone I explained very clearly what I wanted, a window seat. However some time after booking our flight and before the day we were supposed to fly American Airlines changed the plane. That would not have been too bad if their email that was sent to me did not go into my Spambox. Getting ready to print our boarding passes, I saw this plane was a three seater and I had a choice of the aisle or middle seat! I wanted a window seat and made that very clear to the representative I spoke with when booking my flight. I called American Airlines and told them how upset I was and the rep said there was nothing she could do about it. I am stuck on their plane, it was impossible for me to book another flight with another airlines. When I got on the plane, I asked very quietly if I could have an extra seat belt. Well as I was walking to our seat, the staff member reach out and said Miss, here is the extra seat belt!  I was so embarrassed that I wanted to drop down and hide! Really, to have someone hand you a seatbelt in front of the rest of the passengers just showed me how unprofessional American Airline employees are. I am now on this plane in the aisle and anyone that passes me, hits me! This is what I had to endure the entire flight. We finally arrive and it couldn’t be soon enough. We walk to get our luggage and no luggage! We walk to the office and find out that American Airlines chose to put our luggage on another plane. The lady behind the desk tells us in one hour your luggage will be here. You can wait or they will deliver our luggage to where we are staying! Asking again how long will that take, she said only 1 Hour! Why did I believe her - arriving in New Orleans with heels on and warmer clothes because we were coming from Washington DC on this very uncomfortable flight, we asked to have the luggage delivered to our hotel.  After two hours I try calling their customer service to find my luggage. The lady tells me our luggage is at the airport waiting for a driver to deliver them.

","""avoid using American Airlines""",M Erickson,United States,26th October 2015,,"I booked a flight from Paris to Columbus, with a stop in New York (JFK). Shortly after booking my ticket, I noticed that American Airlines allowed just more than an hour to make the connection. Since I would be coming into JFK on an international flight, and would need to go through customs and re-check baggage before continuing on to my connecting flight. I become concerned about the time crunch and called American Airlines to verify that I would have enough time to make the connection. They assured me that I would, so I moved forward with the planned itinerary. When I arrived into New York from Paris, I was pleased that American Airlines had sent an employee to wait for me at the gate to give me an expedited pass through customs so that I could catch my connecting flight. Unfortunately, after clearing customs, I waited for an additional 30 minutes to get my checked baggage, so that I could re-check it. I literally ran the entire way through the airport to catch my flight. I arrived at my gate exactly 9 minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off, but the flight was already gone. Not only was the door shut, but the airplane was already gone from the gate. This left me wondering why American Airlines authorized a flight to leave early when not all of its passengers had arrived at the gate. I was especially disappointed since I was traveling with my wife and infant son, and we were all very tired after a long day of traveling (we began our journey the day before flying with a different airline into Paris). An American Airlines agent at the gate kindly re-booked me for a flight the next day, but informed me that I would need to wait in the check-in line in order to ask about a hotel voucher. After waiting in line and speaking with a check-in agent about a hotel voucher, I was informed that since my flight from Paris was on time, they would not give me a voucher. I explained that I had run through the airport, and that the reason I had missed my flight was because my bags did not come through for more than 30 minutes after I had cleared customs. The check-in agent seemed to feel genuinely sorry, but reiterated that he would not give me a hotel voucher. Instead, I paid $300 to get a decent hotel on short notice. It is frustrating and unfortunate that American Airlines would feel it more important to avoid additional cost than to reimburse a customer for an expense that American Airlines had caused. American Airlines made two mistakes:  They authorized a flight to push off early, even though they knew they had passengers rushing from a connecting flight.  They did not give a hotel voucher even though they were late in getting checked bags to the carousel, resulting in a missed flight and need for a place to stay for the night. Nobody likes to be taken advantage of when they are vulnerable. This is how American Airlines treated me and my family. For this reason, I will avoid using American Airlines in the future when possible.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Columbus via JFK,August 2015,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3,Recommendedno

I arrived at 2pm for the flight. It was marked as 'delayed' and re-scheduled for 5:45pm departure.  At about 5pm I moved my seat closer to the gate counter to listen to the staff conversation about updates. They had probably a dozen conversations with maintenance people, pilots, etc  all in hushed tones to one another. Then, when someone would approach the staff, they would rudely say 'we know nothing - you'll have to sit back down and wait'. Super rude to nearly every person who approached to ask. At 7.30pm - after only 1 announcement over a speaker about what is happening, they canceled the flight. A long line of people had been waiting to talk to gate attendants for the last several hours, but most of the attendants were just beyond rude - no information, wouldn't look at people, just kept typing away for hours with nothing actually happening. We run down to the ticketing booths to get our flights re-booked. Of course, by this time there were no other flights to LAX that night. Again, if people had known an hour earlier that the chances were unlikely that they would get to LAX that night, they would have tried to get on another flight. As I wait in line I re-book a flight over the phone in 5 minutes. However, I then need a hotel voucher, as my flight left at 7am. After waiting in line at the ticketing booth for 2.5 hours someone finally provided vouchers to everyone waiting. 7After waiting for hotel shuttle to arrive for 45 minutes, a group of us finally pay for a cab to the hotel. We walk in at 10pm and the lone hotel staffer has no idea that we were coming, and also has no idea what airline vouchers are. They also only have 4 rooms available. As our group finally gets rooms a large group arrives from our plane with vouchers in hand, only to be told there were no rooms available. I'm guessing these people, after spending 8 hours waiting, just went back to the airport to sleep.  Again - things happen, planes get delayed/canceled by nobody's fault. However if the staff had been remotely professional and fore-thinking, they could have got people with important connections on other flights before it was too late. The staff could have communicated at least a few times over the course of hours to everyone, helping to alleviate the confusion and hysteria that grew out of knowing NOTHING.

While trying to select our seats, the only seats showing available cost an extra $58 per seat. I called AA and the 'customer service' representative informed me that she could make the seat selection for me, but that would cost an extra $25 per seat. I explained that I was requesting assistance because their website wasn't allowing me to make my selection. She said the only way she could help me without an extra charge was to transfer me to their technical assistance department and, if that person there could not help me, he/she could transfer me back to 'customer service' and authorize a waiver. Then, they could make my seat selection without charging me extra. The person at the technical assistance desk informed me that there were seats available at the quoted price, but that I had to complete my purchase, and select my seats 30 minutes afterward. It actually took eight hours to receive a confirmation, and I still could not make a seat selection. Once again I called 'customer service' and the rep informed me that the only way I could select my seats was to pay an additional $25 dollars per reservation. Otherwise, I needed to wait until the day of departure in order to be assigned seats at the gate. They could not even guarantee that we would be seated together. In light of the ridiculous two-day process of trying to get assigned seating, I asked to speak to a supervisor but was refused any assistance, refused to give me her employee ID (finally gave in after five or six requests), and refused to put me in contact with her supervisor.

They don't just have issues on one or two fronts but multiple ones. Being Indian, I am not used to great customer service but the flight attendants in American Airlines put the ones on Air India to shame. They are rude and do not care about your needs. The entertainment system is the worst and their fleet is so old that the screen size could be trumped by some of the bigger phones in the market. There were a total of 10 movies on the plane and the choices were pathetic. The entertainment system is not personalized and they have shows running like in a cinema hall. So if you miss the show start, you join in between. The food was another issue. I had specifically asked for a AVML (Asian Vegetarian Meal) and they told me that they 'call' it VGML (Vegetarian Meal). Nobody from American told me that it is a simple vanilla vegetarian meal consisting of bread, butter, crackers and pasta when I was expecting some food I am used to. I had called American thrice to confirm this and they told me I am all set.  While I was slated to fly back from Chicago, the aircraft developed brake issues and they had to install new ones. This delayed departure by four hours. Every one hour, American would announce that they will tell us soon but even after boarding, we could not take off for 1.5 hours.

Long story, and very sad - we awoke this morning at 2:30 to get the last of the things done around the house necessary to close it for the 6 months we would spend in Dominica. About 3:45 AM, a buddy of mine showed up to take us to the airport. We got to Eppley Airport about 4:30 and had boarding passes about 15 minutes later. Went thru TSA in a breeze – best TSA screening ever for us – very quick. We walked to the departure gate and found a place to sit next to the gate work area. There was activity that early as a flight to Dallas was just before ours. The Dallas flight departed and our flight departure was suddenly changed from 6:05 to 6:59! What gives – no American Airlines rep at the gate would say anything. The only announcement they made was that the crew would be there shortly (25 minutes) (already post departure time). Lynn went to the gate folks and inquired about the flight, particularly because we had a connecting flight in Chicago to SJU. “No Problem” says the guy at the gate – the other flight is late, too, so all is well. You will have plenty of time. Our flight finally boards and departs – well over an hour late. In flight, the pilot announces that the delay was as a result of “crew rest time” as the original crew for this flight got in late the evening before.  We get to Chicago, go like hell to the gate for the SJU flight and get there just in time to see the aircraft preparing to pull away from the terminal. We were not allowed to board as the “door” closed 10 minutes before we got there. At that point, one of the AA reps hands us boarding passes for the next flight to SJU – several hours later. I ask “how about the connecting flight following that one?” Big blank stare, a look of shock on the guy’s face – he never looked to see if there was anything else on our itinerary. Now there is a supervisor involved, both banging away on the keyboards - they have nothing for today as there is only one AA sponsored flight a day into Dominica (DOM). Finally, out of the goodness of their hearts, they offer to put us up in San Juan for the night – but the catch is that the next available seats on Seaborne (AA affiliate) to Dominica are on 15 Oct 2015 –  a week away and they want us to sit in SJU waiting on the AA sponsored flight - then they offer to let us sit in Chicago! I was not happy. It was not our fault that the flight crew was so late getting us out of Omaha. We finally got new ticket vouchers for 15 Oct on the same set of flights as originally set up by Liberty Travel. One small point, our luggage is now missing in action – AA has no idea where it is – they are hunting. And the luggage cost me $50 for this mess. I hope it enjoys the trip. Later, when putting in a “claim” for our AWOL baggage, I find out from an AA employee that AA had no idea the crew was out of flying time and could not even find them in the morning? Had to have the hotel get them. At least that was the story from the ground crew personnel we talked to about the flight.

My colleagues arrived to MIA a bit late due to traffic issues/flooding. We arrived to the airport around 55 min before our departure on AA1265 to PHL. With no bags to check, we proceeded to security where I noticed that my boarding pass would not load on either the mobile app nor via the browser. I told my colleagues to go through security without me, and went to a nearby American Airlines kiosk to print my ticket. It did not work. I tried another kiosk which printed an error ticket, directing me to the counter. I did check-in from home earlier that day and had a reserved seat on this flight. Aware of the lack of time, I informed the check-in line rep of the situation, who referred me to the supervisor. She understood my situation but insisted I wait in the bag check line to print my ticket, despite 0 bags to check. When I said the delay would cause me to miss my flight she unsympathetically told me that I should have arrived 2 hrs early and walked away dismissively. At the counter, the agent printed my ticket easily with no explanation as to why it didn't work on my phone or from the kiosk. I went through security and sprinted to my gate, only to miss it by a few moments (walkway still attached), both of my colleagues aboard. Rebooking was apathetic and booked me standby for 7am.

Then we decided to book another flight to Chicago. We had to fly to 2 places before we officially got to Turks And Caicos! From Boston to Chicago then from Chicago to Miami and then from Miami to Turks And Caicos! Absolutely terrible. As if this wasn't bad enough, the planes were extremely old, and it looks as though they haven't been cleaned in a long time. Interior of the planes we flew were worn out, dusty and grimy. No personal TV's. The only TV's were those old fashioned TV's hanging from the ceiling every few rows that are largely defunct nowadays I was sitting pretty far away and couldn't even watch what was on there. Seats were old, worn out and very uncomfortable. Food was just terrible. Flight attendants were rude and had a bad attitude, making the flight even more miserable. The bathrooms were small and dirty.

Flight on time and no drama. Cabin staff in First Class was attentive and trying to give a good experience. Coffee/Drinks and some pre-packaged cookies were distributed for breakfast. Check-in in ORD was slightly weird. I was using economy check-in kiosks, as they were closest to the door where I entered the airport and had no lines. The first two machines did not work and froze immediately. Going to the next machine I was approached by an American Airlines employee and asked if I needed help. “Probably not, if this machine works”. The third machine finally did work. However, I got a lecture by this officious person that American Airlines requires to be at the airport at least two hours before the flight and actually three hours is needed to make the flight. Aside from the fact that he did not know or ask my departure time or flight number or anything else before lecturing me and the whole area was not busy at all, he was just delaying me while doing the check-in. All officious, surly and completely unwarranted. I finished check-in, went through TSA within 15 minutes and still had more than one hour left to wait at the gate before boarding started. Priority bags out first in MSP. Except for this weird encounter during check-in, the flight was ok, but of course no way near a First Class experience.

At the airport, when we checked in with UA, they informed us of the changes and sent us to AA counter as our trip from Maui to Los Angeles was now with American Airlines. The agents sent us back to UA. The agent at UA was very helpful, printed the itinerary for us and told us that all the information was in order. In the end, the AA manager made some phone call to figure out how to issue our boarding pass and check in our luggage. They could have done that within the first 20 minutes instead of wasting our 1.5 hours in that hot airport. We did not receive any apology. When they issued our boarding passes, our family of four were split into 3 groups, when there were 3 empty rows (9 seats) at the back of the plane. When I walked to the back of the plane and asked the stewardess about putting me and my husband back there, they said no. My guess was those seats were kept for them to sleep/use for storage during the flight. Crew service was average. It was a red eye flight so there was little service required.

On August 26th I left from Vancouver to head to LAX. I was supposed to have a 51 minute layover before I jumped on my next flight to Denver. This was not going to be a problem, I was assured by many staff members that our arrival gate was right next to my departure gate, I did not have any luggage only a carry on, and did not need to go through security, just simply get on the flight. As I boarded my plane, we were told that we would have to sit there for another 45 minutes because LAX was under construction and was not ready for us to arrive at our estimated time. This made my connection now only 25 minutes before departure of my Denver flight, but again I was reassured by staff that this would not be an issue. Upon arrival at 9pm (25 minutes before departure of next flight) the pilot informed us that even though they were aware there were many who needed to run to their connecting flight, we were unable to get off. By the time we got off the plane and ran next door to our gate, American Airlines flight to Denver had already closed the door. I ran to the staff member right away as I was only a minute or two behind the designated ""door closing"" time and was rudely dismissed and told there was nothing that could be done. After waiting 20 minutes, a member came and helped me reschedule my flight for the next morning at 6.30am. Seeing as it was 9.30 pm, I would need accommodation for the night. American Airlines offered zero help with accommodation. In result, seeing as my flight was very early in the morning and I needed to be there the night before, I had to stay at a hotel close by.

I had a code share flight from Geneva with British Airways but I had to change terminal which meant clearing security again - American Airlines has very few European connections at Heathrow so I'd rather transit elsewhere, given the choice. While free wine and beer is a welcome addition in economy class, the food is still lacking in quality and served in little black boxes that give an industrial feel. Integration with US Airways is incomplete; I had a domestic flight segment operated with a US Airways flight number but an aircraft with American Airlines livery on the outside (and US Airways inside) and there was no way to know whether I'd have to pay for my luggage. It ended up costing me $25 from LGA to MSY - no prior warning (and another website that declared the charge would have been cheaper overall). Change of airport required for a connection in New York so I spent a few days there. Generally the cabin crew were pretty friendly and I appreciated the interiors in the new Boeing 777-300ER with individual IFE. On the way home, they would have wanted me to pay $25 to choose any other seat on my flight from MSY to DFW but the back row; $75 to choose anything but a middle seat between DFW and LHR. I thought this was stingy, especially since I checked in early. Also, when I tried to check in online, the AA website sent me to US Airways and then US Airways sent me back to AA. With my BA legs I had 3 different booking codes (I had to find the US Airways one from Check My Trip). Flight out of LGA was late - the captain never came on to explain why it took so long to taxi to the runway - but the crew were great, eg. making people change seats just before landing so that anyone with a tight connection got an aisle seat. Overall I felt that this experience was not bad; better than United but I would always choose a European Airline over American Airlines if I could. A lot of disabled people were helped by the ground crew which was good.

The flight was delayed overall by at least an hour, we spent the majority of the delay time sat waiting to set off due to a ""Minor repair"" which was announced by the pilot over the tannoy once we were on board quite some time later. Our delay continued probably due to missing our take off slot, it wasn't clear because no-one really explained what was happening. Within this time period, the cabin crew turned up and suggested we should move to another seat, we'd been settled into our seats for 20-25 minutes and had chosen seats towards the rear of the plane close to the toilets. When we tried to reserve a seat together before flying, it was fairly limited at the time and we were happy enough to be here however the lady suggested they'd be making a lot of noise behind us and would probably be bashing about around the seats as it appeared they'd used up the back row for their stuff and seating, we said this was OK initially but she continued to prompt us to move, we started to do so with us having to start moving and packing up our stuff, there wasn't much in the way of help on offer and we were made to feel like we were causing more of an inconvenience by booking ahead to get our seats, no suggestion of where were going was made initially which resulted in us moving without our stuff and in the end all the confusion and messing about just raised our stress levels. It appeared in the end that some of the cabin crew had taken up the seats around us and thankfully some of the crew, particularly one of the younger female crew members and another gentleman were very courteous and offered help with a clearly very upset passenger, the other more senior staff could do to perhaps follow their lead as their idea of customer service was far below expected. Aside from this, this particular plane had screens above rather than individual ones on the back of the seats, one film was offered, food was OK, same usual fare, I assume from the amount of chatter about drinks I heard that there was a shortage of certain drinks, particularly beer at one point. Generally, I'm disappointed as this is one of the longest and one of the most expensive flights I've been on.

",American Airlines customer review,Lorraine Atoui,United States,18th August 2015,,"Unbelievably poor service, communication, and accommodation provided by the AA staff in Chicago. After delayed flight from Traverse City, MI, my flight from Chicago to San Diego was also delayed. Very little communication at the gate by staff, as we watched the monitor change the departure time over and over again. First a delay of two hours, then half an hour, then two minutes here, 10 minutes there and before you know it, the flight was delayed until 11 pm. This was extremely frustrating to be strung along for so long. At the very last second, the gate crew made an unintelligible announcement that our flight was being rerouted to LAX. This created chaos and provided only minutes for people to try and make arrangements at their final destinations before boarding and take off. Announcements were difficult to hear and brusquely delivered. On the plane, the crew was perfunctory and unhelpful. The reason for the rerouting was that the San Diego airport would be closed at midnight and we would not make it in time. I am sure the airline staff knew this and could have provided that information in a much more timely fashion than it did. Very disappointing to be treated with such disrespect, disregard and callousness. A bus was provided for the final leg to San Diego, making the trip a grueling all night, uncomfortable affair.

",American Airlines customer review,D Tong,United States,16th August 2015,,"On hold for 20-30 min about my missing checked luggage at this writing. My miserable experience began with their two competing online sites - one to make reservation thereafter just to be told to use other site to select seats, asking me for a ""locator"" code which wasn't given in the first instance. After much struggles and hassles connecting by phone with life agent adding a child to my travelling party, and entering payment info, screen got stuck at ""please wait a moment while processing etc"" through the night. Next morning I finally woke up to the idea of installing their Android app on my smart phone. When at long last I managed to reach the seating plan, the two last remaining economy seats I selected were no more and I was left with having to pay extra for the extra legroom seats. Upon boarding I was appalled by the aged aircraft and obsolete amenities. No individual screens, no plug-ins for phones, not even basic earphones provided unless you pay $5. Both featured movies were 2nd rate and displayed on some heavy CRT suspended units which emitted a very annoying glare during the red-eye flight. The extra legroom was not worthwhile or all that noticeable, as an equally crucial attribute was the lateral tightness of the seats which caused the usual shoulder-rubbing and sleeplessness. It was all-in-all was a strange throw-back to the 70s. For a flight of such duration, there was only one serving of drinks but even then, no snack of any sort. There were no pillows, but some left-over garbage from an earlier flight in the seat pocket. I arrived at baggage claim before others and there was a very long interlude for belt to start moving. Eventually after a prolonged and futile watch, my checked luggage was never forthcoming so I headed to their baggage service to report missing luggage. Luckily agent was helpful and wait wasn't long to write up the delayed baggage claim. However I was perturbed by the sheer number of displaced/delayed baggage affecting over hundred other passengers. An agent finally picked up my call after 35 minutes wait. Their online baggage status still has no update on my luggage where-about.

We were so close to not making it even though we were responsible with booking the layover times. If there is such a risk of passengers not making it don't schedule flights for those times! Part of the problem was the need to claim baggage and recheck it which we were not informed of when we booked the flights. It took far too long for our baggage to come and there was no one around to answer questions about whether or not more baggage was coming. Then after running to make it we still didn't take off on time. We sat for 30 mins at the gate while they fixed some problem in cargo.

O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later.

I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation.

To start, the boarding began 20 minutes late because a previous American Airlines flight to Seattle was delayed. CDG is a shocking airport. I wasn't looking forward to the old B767 that we would fly either. But flight took off on time and wasn't that bad. I slept most of the time, partly due to a lack of personal entertainment. The only entertainment was an overhead screen showing some terrible movie. Crew was good, particularly one. Can't remember his name but you'll know when you meet him. Food was okay, main meal was decent, the ice-cream and snacks were excellent. Flight landed on time. So all in all a very average flight, but I won't recommend it.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris CDG to New York JFK,July 2015,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3,Recommendedno

Nobody was offered an explanation as to why we were delayed. We had not one, but 3 gate changes, and our party was traveling with someone who needed assistance. The airport in Miami is huge and after the last gate change, we were told that our flight would leave in 30 min. The AA agent made one phone call for assistance and then left us to our own devices. We had to frantically scramble to find a golf cart, wheelchair, someone to assist. Many of the other passengers on the flight were outraged and not one AA representative gave us any reason why our flight kept getting postponed. Finally, when we boarded at 11.30, the pilot explained that extreme weather kept us from leaving on time.

Directed to counters to deal with and maybe try and book next flight. No apology, staff were unhelpful and counter staff downright ""offish"" to the situation. I was even told the mobile app doesn't communicate with flight counter so its information can be incorrect. So the question is what's the point of the app if doesn't provide up-to-date info.

We bought tickets a month before our flight and ended up paying almost $700 each roundtrip (for 4 of us). On June 21st we drove 2 hours to Charlotte Airport and on our way we got an automated call telling us our flight had been cancelled for maintenance (at around 11.30) on a beautiful, clear day. Not knowing what to do we continued to the airport terminal and through the check-in line. The employee at the check-in said we had been rescheduled on a flight for the next day at 5.30am. This wasn't an acceptable alternative for us so we were put on standby for a 4.30 flight but then we had to check-in our stowaway luggage. We asked how we would get our luggage back if we didn't make it on the 4.30 flight, and were told that the luggage was marked for standby and would not be put on the plane without us. Past security we checked with other United Airways employees who assured us this was the case. These employees were all helpful and patient with us. We waited in the airport for hours for the standby flight, which unsurprisingly did not have space for all 4 of us. We were sent to baggage claim and waited for luggage that never showed up. Our bags had been sent to Toronto YYZ without us. I called Toronto Pearson airport where a helpful woman connected me to the United Airways baggage office.

These things sometimes happen, but what followed was not acceptable. Customer service representatives had no solutions for anyone, other than bookings for the next flight 24 hours later. No hotel, transportation, nothing. My service at the desk was dismissive: we can't help. We have no solutions or contingencies. It was only after my pestering them, when she handed me the dreaded ""pink slip"" - a generic phone number and website for ""discount"" on a hotel. The biggest problem is that customer service failed spectacularly at the point where the client is most vulnerable and alone-in transit. There should be a representative for each imperiled connecting flight, or group of flights. On-ground coordinators should be communicating with gate agents and in-flight attendants.

",American Airlines customer review,Matthew Butler,United States,17th June 2015,,"Throughout my recent trip, there were difficulties due to under-staffing at the terminals and ticket check-in, leading to several long delays. Several of us missed our first flight out of Gainesville since there was miscommunication leading to no one being at the check-out counter prior to our departure and none of the boarding pass kiosks working. The return flights were equally difficult, with only 1 kiosk working and only one person working the ticket counter, which lead to check-in requiring about an hour. Several of the initial flights were delayed, leading to several of us missing our connection. While this is understandable and does occur at times, it took approximately 2 hours to receive our hotel vouchers even though the flight arrangements were made prior. This was again due to being under-staffed as only 1 person was working this terminal. The following day, multiple flights were cancelled due to ""mechanical difficulties"" leading several of us to again miss our flights. This again lead to an almost 2 hour wait in order to re-book after already waiting an hour prior to the flight being cancelled, causing many of us to miss our chance at making a compatible connection flight. I was initially told I would again have to stay over-night and was not given further options. After calling customer service myself, I found a flight to an airport 2.5 hours away although I was required to pay the rental car fee to drive back home.

The woman at the check in counter knew nothing about free bags for military civilians. After paying for our bag, she gave us our boarding pass and mentioned nothing about it being delayed. We found out after I noticed that the time was different on our boarding pass. When the time came to board, we find out that the flight is cancelled when we noticed no plane at our gate. We approached some AA attendants and the woman apologized for forgetting to announce it, and then looked for another flight for us. She found one for a 5am flight - 4.30am check in and gave us a hotel voucher of which the shuttle runs every half hour. That means we would have to leave the hotel at 3am in order to make the flight. At 2.30am, my boyfriend finds out through the flight tracker to discover it is cancelled again! He tries to call customer service to reschedule but had a 1 hour wait time on the phone. When he finally gets through, the man on the phone suggested a flight at JFK at 7am, which we wouldn't be able to make it in time even if we left at that moment (3.40) because we would have to wait for the (every 30 min) shuttle, get on the airport train, get to the stop for long term parking, then get the bus to get us to our car, and then drive over an hour to JFK. So then he puts us on a 3.50 flight to Chicago getting us there at nearly 6pm. Our whole Saturday is gone. AA wasted us a lot of money and time. I will never fly with them again.

",American Airlines customer review,Sheila Warmisham,United Kingdom,13th June 2015,,"What has happened? Airlines have revolved into greedy money making machines and in turn allowed people to become smug and uncaring for others. What used to happen in my day when a person of 6ft 5ins boarded a plane there was consideration and care? Now it is all about extra money! I distinctly remember when this situation arose we would kindly ask smaller exit seated passengers to swap and 9 times out of ten people would be happy to do so. We maybe would offer a few drinks in return and everyone was happy. My son who is 6ft 5in was like a caged animal on our recent American Airlines flight, 10 hours of absolute hell. Yes we could have paid more for an exit seat but he is a student and this was not an option. While shorter passengers get seats for less he is now faced with either having to pay more to travel than shorter people or not travel at all. It is not as if he can do anything about his height, if he was simply overweight – then he could diet – but this is not the case. American Airlines allowed him to stand up all the way from LA to LHR for 10 hours, when he had to sit his legs had to be wide apart and any chance of a brace position would be completely ruled out. American Airlines – shame on you for your greed! I am not sure why trolleys were used for the meal service – they could have just chucked boxes of junk down the cabin and asked those interested to catch them.

The flight to DFW was delayed for a mechanical problem (air speed indicator), so they re-boarded us on a different plane, but after all

Meanwhile after an hour standing in line, they called us back to the second airplane and the ones of us who hadn't left in search of another flight, toted rolling bags etc on board yet a third time and we sat and continued to wait while the baggage was loaded. This leg of the trip had begun with the supposed 12.25 pm departure of Flight 2407, but by now it was 5.30 pm, with no signs of hope.

The flight to Seattle from Philadelphia went smoothly. I was able to check in board and fly without problem and it was actually one of my most pleasant flights. However when I tried to check in for the return flight I was informed that my ticket had been cancelled. After waiting on hold for a long time one of the American Airlines representatives informed me that the ticket was cancelled because I never boarded the plane in Philadelphia. Eventually I was told that if I showed my boarding pass from the flight from Philadelphia to Seattle to a check-in representative they would be able to book a seat on the flight for me. However until that time the seat was not reserved for me or guaranteed in any way. It was important that I make the flight in order to be at work so I had to make an extra trip to the airport early so I could re-book my ticket thereby wasting precious vacation time. So do not fly on American Airlines unless you enjoy the thrill of not knowing if you'll get to use the ticket you bought the mystery of whether the airline knows you're on the plane or not and the excitement of using vacation time to pick your way through a companies complex inaccessible and unable customer service system.,,Economy Class,,,5.0,1.0,4.0,,,,1,Recommendedno

Then finally this flight from LGA is scheduled to take off 6 hours later than actual scheduled timings which means the connecting flight has already left.

FA on the second leg more relaxed in delivering service but still ok. Catering for the first (evening) leg was a chicken or pasta choice with the chicken dish bland and just barely edible. Not good enough even for economy on many other airlines. Also strange that AA considers the chicken or pasta choice a First Class offering on a three hour dinner time flight probably only possible on the US market. Wines served were ok and regular refills offered by the good FA. First Class breakfast RNO-ORD leg was cereal with no other option. Again how this can be considered a First Class breakfast for a four hour flight is beyond me.

We (three of us) were rebooked on the flight to Narita (Japan) and onto Seoul the following day. Although technically that flight would have left technical ‘issues’ meant that we left 7.5 hours late arriving in Narita at about 11pm. What a contrast - upon arrival there were about 15 Japanese customer service people with individual ‘packages’ for passengers containing onward boarding passes details of buses to pre-arranged hotel accommodation and a food box. Next day a special bus took us back to the airport for our onward flight to Seoul. Our luggage was not so lucky – even with the 7 hour delay at Dallas AA was unable to send our luggage out for another 2 days! The return flight was ‘better’ – in that there wasn't a delay but the flight was cramped – the 777 clearly had not been ‘spring cleaned’ since its delivery many many years ago the food was mediocre at best and the ‘entertainment system’ simply because it was entertaining trying to find anything of interest to watch/listen to.

",American Airlines customer review,D Graubard,United States,10th May 2015,,AA2320 - May 7 2015. Inaugural 787 flight on AA - DFW to ORD. Fun flight - a lot of press at the boarding area. Photos were taken of each passenger standing in front of a green screen so that you would get a picture printed with you in front of the plane. 82 people on the upgrade list for a completely full flight - most I've ever seen. Boarding was smooth - about 90% of the passengers were airline/aviation enthusiasts that purposely were on the flight. Flight attendants/pilots were all jovial and happy to show off the new plane. Water-cannon send-off from Terminal D - then a nice smooth take-off with cheers from passengers. Good inflight entertainment - but still they show the same shows that were on flights I took 9 months ago. Why can't American keep updated entertainment? Emirates/Singapore/Qantas/British all do it. Drink and BOB on board - people walking all over the plane between First and Coach taking pictures. Camera-men filming the cabins and passengers reactions. Landed early at ORD and quick disembarkation. Overall a good flight and cheap fare.,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,Recommendedyes

We've traveled to over 70 countries world wide and this was the first and last time we'll ever use American Airlines. They use a 777-200 out of Chicago which resembles a cattle car the way passengers are packed into the economy section. 2-5-2 configuration and while we paid extra to sit in the two side the seats were so cramped there wasn't enough room between rows to put the tray table down for meals. When the passengers in front reclined their seats it was claustrophobic. Keep in mind this is a 14 hour flight. Ironically enough the flight attendants who refer to this equipment as the Slave Ship told us AA is talking about adding another row of seats. Meals were horrid power port and audio jacks didn't work and the ""entertainment"" system is laughable. We had three flights in China on China Eastern Airlines while we were there and their aircraft were all modern clean and spacious.

The staff are rude and abrupt at check-in the meals are terrible and you cannot purchase anything else on board they didn't have earphones or the option to purchase on board (for a long haul flight from Philadelphia to Dublin) and none of the reading lights worked in our row. Aside from this the planes are extremely old to the point where it was genuinely terrifying. The insulation is extremely thin in comparison to other planes so you can hear every noise the engine makes!

I was asked to check in my carry on in Dallas because they were not going to have enough space in the overhead compartments.

The Heathrow flight was on time and the service was ok but not great. A little too ""matter of fact"" if I can use that term. Our flight from DFW was a different affair. Because we couldn't book our seats we were advised to ask at the desk at Dallas. When we arrived I was impressed that they knew we were coming but added"" we think we have four seats spare but leave it with us"". I had already had trouble booking seats from Heathrow with not wanting to pay and extra £30 pre booking fee! We eventually did get 4 seats. 2 at the front and two at the back. The attendants were efficient although abrupt. On our return flight again we couldn't book the seats we wanted and got split up yet again on DFW to Heathrow leg. The Staff were quite rude to all passengers. One fellow passenger asked what choice was for breakfast? ""Only one option"" was the reply ""take it or leave it""! We got the impression that they didn't really want to be there. Many reading lights and video screens were not working just what you need on an overnight transatlantic trip!

",American Airlines customer review,Eric Allen,United States,28th April 2015,,"Will not be flying with this airline again. Was traveling from Seattle to Houston Hobby through DFW. Plane was delayed on the runway for over an hour because American couldn't communicate with their own computer system in Dallas. Because of the delay we landed in DFW just 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to leave in another terminal. Hauled over to that terminal only to see a completely different flight posted at my gate with no agents in site. Found another gate with an agent and told him my situation. He put me on standby for another flight to Houston. I was called from the standby list and put on that flight they asked me to gate check my bag. Then after I was seated they called me off the airplane saying they had double booked my seat! They could not return my bag to me. Put me on yet another flight to Houston for two hours later. But that gate listed information for another flight. Talking with other customers it became clear that none of the gates displayed the appropriate flights it was utter chaos with agents switching gates for flights every 15 minutes or so and disgruntled passengers everywhere. Meanwhile it turns out that the flight they kicked me off of was cancelled because the pilot had reached his maximum number of hours before the flight ever left. Everyone on that flight was moved to my new flight. Eventually they boarded the flight and then sat at the gate for an hour because as the captain put it ""someone who needs to be on the flight is not on it."" The passenger sitting next to me showed me radar on her phone indicating that a storm was rolling in that would prevent us from leaving if we didn't leave soon. Many passengers started shouting to the crew asking why we hadn't left yet and many openly started wondering if the crew was actually making excuses to delay the flight until it was cancelled. Remember that many of these passengers had been on a cancelled flight just a few hours before. Anyway the captain did wait long enough that a storm rolled in as predicted. We were told we would need to fly out of the other side of the airport and circle around the storm so we taxied over. Once we were all the way on the other end we were told the new route required more fuel than we had so we had to return to the gate. Then we were told the ramp was closed so there was no gate for us to refuel at so we had to just wait. Finally a gate opened up for us but we just sat there for another hour. Then the captain told us that he reached his maximum number of flying hours so the flight was cancelled.

PROS: First Class check-in due to my One World Emerald Tier status; Flights on time except for DFW-SEA that left the gate on time but returned due to a mechanical problem that resulted in a delayed departure of an hour and arrival in SEA 40 minutes late. All planes clean and either new or fairly new. Staff efficient and most were quite friendly except for one on the SEA-DFW segment who had an attitude problem. Snacks for sale on three of the four segments and complimentary beverages served on all segments seats comfortable except for DCA-DFW (see CONS). Baggage transferred efficiently and delivered on the carousels at SEA and IAD very quickly as they had One World priority tags. CONS: The Admiral's Club Lounges look nice with comfortable seats but the free snack offerings at DFW were pitiful DCA-DFW had a brand new plane with the new B737 sky interior and AA leather seats. This was outstanding though sadly ruined by two awful boxes for the seat back video screens anchored on both sides of the middle seat foot well. This was pathetic for legroom on even a three-hour flight; Any airline that can find a very compact version of this video control box is a winner! Overall despite the many negative reviews that I have read recently about AA I was very satisfied with this trip and will definitely use them again.

Our flight was supposed to be one of the first that left that day so we were ate the airport very early. Check in was 4 am. Of all the flights in the entire airport ours was delayed 2 hours. Why? Because they said it did not get in till late the previous day. Well that delay messed up our connecting flight in Dallas-Fort Worth so the day got worse and our total day was extended 6-7 hours. I understand that there are times when issues cannot be avoided but the airline booking personnel just didn't seem to care. We paid extra for the priority seating but they just threw us in the pool of last place seating until we got in their face. They did give us a meal voucher good for one of the vendors in the airport but only when we had to demand it. The pilot explained that there are rules of mandatory rest between flights which we understand but that news was known the previous day so why did we not get notified? The connecting flight was also delayed due to maintenance of passenger seats. For our return flight home my wife and I were praying for no issues but American Airlines made sure that we would not go home happy. The flight from West Palm Beach to Dallas-Fort Worth was pretty routine in the air but flight was delayed leaving the airport due to some ""auxiliary power"" issue that maintenance had to remedy before take off. When we arrived in Dallas-Fort Worth the powered boarding shute needed maintenance's attention before we could exit the plane into the terminal so we had to wait for that fix. As luck would have it our connecting flight was delayed another 1.5 hours! I will definitely find another airline before I choose this one again.

Instead they notified us that there was no plane. We didn't have a plane to board until 5.30pm and the plane didn't depart until 6.20pm that evening. Over a 3 hour delay due to not having an available plane. Before we took off the pilot notified us that due to weather they were going to have to take a more Western route and were not sure if they were going to have enough fuel. Instead of actually getting more fuel we took off anyway. 30 min into the flight they notified us that there was a line to land into HOU due to weather and that they didn't have enough fuel and needed to land in San Antonio. Not only did we not get into SA until 8pm but the crew notified us that they had flown too many hours. So even if we did get more fuel there was no crew to fly the plane. At this point we were stranded in San Antonio and the weather had become so bad in Houston there were no planes out. We were stranded.

It was hard to hear and broadcast only once. Several of us had to confirm with an attendant that it was indeed canceled that we had to pick up our luggage at the baggage area and return to the check-in counter. My wife and I along with the others scrambled to navigate our way through the airport area finally to the baggage area. After what seemed like a very long wait our luggage along with a handful of others' came out last. This meant that when we finally found our way back to the AA check-in area we were at the end of an extremely long line. Eventually my wife and I ""split"" with her waiting on a long line at an AA service counter. After about 3 hours she made it to the front while I still had many people ahead of me. AA booked us on Iberia flights for the following day and a hotel with paid meals. We were then given directions to a free hotel shuttle. We never found it and ended up paying for a taxi but the driver took us to the ""wrong"" airport hotel. Fortunately that hotel let us take their shuttle to the ""right"" hotel. It's surprising but almost understandable that AA had no ""backup airplane"". My complaint is less about the cancellation and more about the lack of assistance at Barcelona Airport. Announcements and guidance was poor. There was no one to help us navigate back to the baggage area. We had to wait on a customs line to get back ""in"" so that we could go to the baggage area.

We booked our four flights each London-Chicago-Nashville and back through BA. BA were supposed to take us as far as Chicago with American Airlines doing the Chicago to Nashville bit. We missed our connection at both legs of the journey which was hugely inconvenient particularly when returning to the UK. To be fair AA brought us back to Chicago airport in time but for some reason the they were not given a gate for more than an hour. I approached the flight attendant asking whether AA can communicate with BA about this delay particularly as there were several people apart from us who were due to catch the same flight. She said that the flight will probably wait for us they know that we are being delayed. This resulted in a mad run between terminals 3 and 5 in vain. We were then sent back to AA desk in Terminal 3 to rebook our tickets for another flight. AA staff took a very long time to process each person. By the time we finished it was more than 1.5 hrs after we started queuing. We were told that the we will be put on AA flight to London tomorrow afternoon. There are many flights between London and Chicago and we requested an earlier flight. The person dealing with us said that if we wanted tickets to an earlier flight we should have come earlier. She refused to check whether BA had any flights the next day. In fact they were as unhelpful as possible. I made a point that we paid tickets for the flight that just left and had we managed to be on it we would not be asking for anything. We were told that we cannot collect our luggage as 'it has gone to BA'. We were given vouchers for an airport hotel and forced to stay overnight without luggage and they reluctantly gave us two sets of very basic things such as toothbrush and toothpaste for us three.

They could not locate our luggage.

We were told that the flight crew was coming from OK however all the passengers from OK are on board and the flight attendants said they could not find pilots.

",American Airlines customer review,Neil Snee,United Kingdom,12th April 2015,,LHR-MIA March/April. We were sold this round trip on the 'new' AA Business Class product. We knew it was a 777-300ER LHR-MIA and a 777-300 back. The outbound was fantastic with great service seats AVOD and everything one should expect from a modern BC cabin. we have flown Emirates BC 4 times in the past 6 months and this cabin is comparable to both the A380 and the 777 in that class defining airline. Whilst we found the service in Emirates a bit disorganised AA was efficient friendly and warm we like the more mature no nonsense crew on Airlines out of the States although it's a thin line to rude and dis-interested on occasions! However AA should be ashamed scheduling a 200 version for the return leg which was not a result of a last minute 'change out' due to failure but that quote ' The newer plane has been stolen for Los Angeles some weeks ago'. Call me sad but I would have changed my flight if I'd known we'd be on this antique! Lie at an angle beds a 10 inch screen maybe 11 low def (love the jumpy fuzzy effects reminded me of the 90s) and the general feel of a very tired plane! What was different was the excellent service and food I was annoyed when I sat down but slept for 3 hours and was relaxed when I got off. AA has begun to catch up it's got some way to go and given the lounge experience (don't ever ever call sparkling wine Champagne!) there is a way to go the crew are spot on and at the end of the day that's what makes a flight. Seat score is for the 777-300ER but oddly it's not great for couples as these seats are very. 'Pod' like and chatting to each other isn't easy AVOD score is the new plane.,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,Recommendedyes

I booked this route especially to take this newer plane for the inflight entertainment which did not disappoint. I found the crew okay and some even smiled! What I disliked about AA was the exorbitant prices they charge for pre-allocated seats which was a necessity in order to seat a family of 4 together. The food was mostly below average but having read reviews I wasn't surprised. I don't like the way they have chosen to add another seat to each row in economy. So instead of 9 abreast they have made it 10. This makes the aisle ridiculously narrow and I don't see how hundreds of people would be able to escape in an emergency so I'm surprised the FAA permits this higher density seating. Legroom was tight for anyone of above average height. I also found it strange how the seat belt sign was illuminated for virtually the whole flight - in both directions - and there are hardly any announcements from the flight deck even when turbulence is quite choppy. I chose AA for the equipment they use on this route but I would think twice about booking them again due to the hidden costs that aren't factored into the ticket price.,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,1,Recommendedno

They all wore different clothing as though they had turned up from home and not bothered to change. They were totally uncommunicative - amazingly not a word was spoken to us through the entire journey. One of the crew fell asleep in a seat at the back of the cabin. Food was served as though they were doing us a favour and just dropped in front of us without a word there was not a friendly smile between them. One of the crew was not tall enough to close the overhead lockers. I cannot believe AA are spending so much on renewing their fleet yet seem totally unconcerned that their staff are behaving in this way.

On arrival at Manchester the airline staff quizzed us in detail about where else we usually travelled to why we were going to the States what jobs we did. This took about 10 minutes. Check in was via a machine designed to make AA a staff saving however it did nothing for their customers most of whom were frustrated at its inability to work. The whole crew were late and ran through the airport together to take up their posts. Did this account for them not checking whether the passengers had on their seat belts or arm rests in the correct position? Apparently not as it was exactly the same on the return flight. The safety video could not be viewed by passengers seated by the window due to the low overhead and central hanging videos. Did the crew have a uniform? They all dressed differently some wore extensive amounts of jewellery and chewed gum others had not even combed or tidied their hair. All were markedly scruffy compared to every other airline I have ever flown with. More worrying was that none of the crew advised passengers to remain seated when the seat belt light was lit and passengers proceeded to walk around the cabin throughout the flight. Or maybe it was the Captain's error in not turning the light off at all. Who knows whether we even had a Captain as on the out flight no announcements were even made! Not impressive on safety at all.

Not a single good thing I can say about my experience with American. I have flown Southwest Delta Jetblue Frontier and this is by far the worst airline I have flown. We had an hour and a half delay the first flight plus an emergency situation so we missed our connecting flight which has never happened to me. They supplied us with the worst hotel overnight. It wasn't just us that missed our flight 5 other families on separate ones missed theirs too. Then the flight the next day got delayed 30 minutes! So our three day trip turned into one day from all the delays and missed flights. Finally heading home and they announce mechanical problems with the plane. So now the flight is delayed 2 hours and we are missing our connecting flight to Salt Lake. So we get to board on a 6 pm flight but let's not kid ourselves that'll be delayed too so probably 7. And then it's a 4.5 hour flight so I'll be getting home at 2am.

The courteous and helpful ticket desk staff re-booked our free ticket LHR-JFK-RDU. We were told with great pride that the transatlantic portion would be aboard AA's new flagship 777-300ER. I applaud AA as being the only U.S. airline to give it's customers the opportunity to ride the latest and finest of American ingenuity technology and manufacturing excellence. It did strike me however that AA may have commissioned a ""lite"" version of the plane as it was missing some of the bells and whistles I had seen on some foreign carriers (wood floors mood lighting etc). Overall the economy interior can best be described as bland. On the plus side mammoth overhead bins decent seats great ride and as good an in flight entertainment system as you'll find anywhere in coach. Watched three excellent first run movies. All we need now is some edible food and AA will have caught up with BA and VS. However as a word of caution to those flying from the US to the UK on AA be aware of the aircraft type when you make your booking. In addition to the new AA Flagship 777-300 the airline also flies the 777-200 which is getting along in age the venerable 767-300 and the 757-200 which in my opinion is not at all suited to Transatlantic travel.",,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,,,5,Recommendedyes

Early morning departure was going well until we reached the gate and found that a problem with a burst pipe meant no baggage could be loaded. However assume this was a knock on from the weather conditions. We were kept relatively well informed about delay which extended to around 3 hrs. However the anticipation of arriving in 85 degrees warmth mitigated the delay. Service on aircraft was fine. We had seats with extra leg room. Inflight entertainment ok. Only soft drinks were free. We had an egg sandwich which was OK. Flight back was also delayed slightly but made up time to arrive near to scheduled time. No queue at immigration.

It also gives me the opportunity to judge the progress of the AA/USAir merger. On the downside the venerable 767-300 is one year older (27 years and counting) still has the mail slot overhead storage bins the ancient hanging screen entertainment and the excruciatingly uncomfortable seats. I did notice that this old warhorse had been updated with blended winglets to save money which I'm certain they pass along to those paying for tickets. On board the hot breakfast croissant has been replaced with a box of sugar laden treats and the dinner has regressed from merely uninteresting to inedible. The flight attendants are excellent given what they have to work with - even giving up their crew rest seats to accommodate the spring breakers who made this a 100% full flight. On the plus side a current movie that I had considered paying to see (Whiplash) swift check-in and 45 minutes early into LHR.

On the most recent trip I can only say that the seating was horrible the flight attendants inattentive. I did like two attendants on the return flight one a male who saw the girl sitting next to me unwilling to put her tray up for takeoff and he firmly said 'you know the drill put the tray up'. You could sense his professionalism and no nonsense approach. He was quite professional. Another attendant was very personal with me and admitted that flying was not what it used to be said that the 777-300 had two back seats that you could not recline and actually defended the passenger in terms of lack of comfort. She said that now it is a question of bringing your own entertainment food all of which surprised me since she was not party line and quite personable apologizing for making me wait ten minutes for some water saying 'I'm sorry I'm in another world today' not so reassuring but she was on top of things. A mixed bag. On the flight to New York the food was awful but a flight attendant when telling her that I need a lot of water subtly gave me an entire bottle in a plastic bag. Perhaps it's because I helped an older passenger with her luggage but still what a shocker. I find that I am very uncomfortable getting off their planes. They have twice lost my luggage once on an earlier flight but found it days later. The latest was really just uncomfortable because of the 2x5x2 seating arrangement on a 777-200. I cannot recommend them for comments like 'whose the next victim?' or 'the entertainment system is not working. We suggest you read a good book and go to sleep'. This was on a flight Buenos Aires New York about three years ago stated in Spanish and English by a flight attendant. Passengers laughed but you could see many were offended by her suggestions.

I could only choose where I wanted to sit 24 hrs before my flight which was fine as most airlines have that policy but what really threw me back was that all aisle and window seats cost an extra $69 - $100 each way depending where the seat was located! You have to pay extra for an aisle seat at the back of the plane on a 10hr transatlantic flight? This is not easyjet or Ryanair for goodness sake! The so called cheap flight on a major airline was not so cheap after all as they were already nickel and diming before getting off the ground. I refused to pay and went for a free middle seat which I loath I have wide shoulders and have to hunch inwards my plan was to arrive early and hope the check-in desk could sort me out with an aisle seat which they were able to do but that is where the Customer satisfaction stopped.) Plane was on time and boarding was reasonably quick and I was perched in my aisle seat which was very narrow I also noticed many people getting their roller cases stuck in the aisles as they tried to roll them down but it turns out that in an effort to squeeze an extra seat in each row American Airlines compromised with narrower seats and aisles. In the air nightmare #1 The narrow aisle caused one particular cabin crew to bump the trolley into my shoulder or elbow without even so much as an apology. #2 You get free beer and wine but the entire cabin ran out beer and white wine before the first drinks trolley finished its first pass. #3 The plane was old and the only movies available played at set times (not on demand) that's right 2015 with 90s technology - AA may have painted their planes but they are still old and nasty inside.

We got inside and some of the monitors were not working and the seats barely reclined. The flight attendants were very nice and passed out drinks but I still don't understand why they do not offer snacks on a 3.5 hour flight. My flight from MIA-MSP was terrible. We arrived at MIA airport getting ready for our flight at 1pm. We find out it is cancelled and the airline did not give us a reason why so we were rescheduled for a 2pm flight.

Once the time finally comes to board the flight bound to MSP we get onto the plane which previously came from Mexico City. The flight attendants were very welcoming however they then tell us over the speaker that this plane was out of service and that American Airlines must find us a new plane to fly on.

",American Airlines customer review,William Slattery,Canada,9th March 2015,,Recently we traveled to Cancun from Calgary Canada with an over nighter in Dallas Fort Worth. Our flights down were for the most part uneventful with only minor delays out of Calgary and Dallas. However coming back on the 28th of Feb was the worst experience we have ever had in over 30 years of flying. We were stuck in an enormous backlog of passengers in Cancun Airport the majority of the backlog was with American Airlines. Not withstanding the fact that there were storms all over the southern US the American staff assisting passengers in the line-up un-organized cluster that accrued in the terminal was appalling! They could not organize anything and upset passengers constantly. They were so incompetent that they would have had difficulty organizing a staff bathroom break. We where in the line-up for 5.5 hours and never saw a listing for our flight till we finally went through security and even then they had the gate location mixed up.

We got inside and some of the monitors were not working and the seats barely reclined. The flight attendants were very nice and passed out drinks but I still don't understand why they do not offer snacks on a 3.5 hour flight. My flight from MIA-MSP was terrible. We arrived at MIA airport getting ready for our flight at 1pm. We find out it is cancelled and the airline did not give us a reason why so we were rescheduled for a 2pm flight. When we went to board the 2pm flight we find out that they cancelled our seats for that flight and replaced them with a 9pm flight. We had to stay in MIA airport for an additional 7 hours! Once the time finally comes to board the flight bound to MSP we get onto the plane which previously came from Mexico City. The flight attendants were very welcoming however they then tell us over the speaker that this plane was out of service and that American Airlines must find us a new plane to fly on. So we get all of our luggage off the plane and leave the gate once again tired and exhausted.

My expectations were set fairly low as these were my 11th and 12th transit of DFW on American over the last 6-7 years but wanted to burn off some miles. Of these trips I can now say that 2 have departed on time out of this place. That said my trip down to MEX was uneventful. Food was fair at best and F/A's smiles seemed missing but was on time. The departure out of MEX back to Dallas was delayed by Radar problems at MEX. This set off a chain of events that resulted in a missed connection at DFW and while 90% could be attributed to the Radar problem. The flight was not posted on airport monitors and the gate was changed. The departure gate did not have the flight displayed so people had to ask if this was indeed for the DFW flight. Once on board the pilot announced a 59 minute traffic delay due to an early full ground stop. That 59 minutes went by plus another 20 or so with no further word from the crew. Late passengers arrived about an hour after the scheduled time and once loaded the door was shut and we pushed back. Since I signed up for Emails I received no fewer than 14 Emails that I didn't read until arrival in DFW which caused connection confusion that even one of their agents could not explain. As it turned out due to carry on bag only I could have made my first flight but apparently they gave my seat away thinking there would be no way I could make it. Coming into DFW I checked online and it showed what looked like I had been rebooked on the 2nd of 2 remaining flights but Emails after arrival which were generic made me think I had been rebooked on the first of the two. All 3 remaining flights were at different terminals which didn't help.

",American Airlines customer review,Christy Hoss,United States,26th January 2015,,"Flight 287. Our Flight was supposed to be non-stop from Miami to LA. Plane developed a problem as we sat waiting to leave the terminal. It took 2 hours to determine it was not fixable. We were compensated with headsets and two granola bars while we waited for the news that American Airlines was trying to find another plane. No plane was available so we deplaned and waited another hour in the terminal for the decision to fly to Phoenix where we could refuel on the same plane and go on to LA. By now the flight is 4 hours late leaving. Arriving in Phoenix the captain said ""Good news is we are in Phoenix the bad news is the crew has to stand down due to FAA regulations."" Another delay - All the passengers were shuttled around to other flights. It's late we are all exhausted and had been lead along by a string of lies. We missed our connecting flight by 6 hours and had to stay in LA. Two granola bars and a pair of headsets. One lie leads to another creating distress for the passengers and the consequent employees that had to deal with the avalanche that resulted from a full-flight of unhappy flyers. It was a nightmare.

",American Airlines customer review,A Sahni,United States,23rd January 2015,,DFW to Milan Italy via JFK in December 2014. On check in for this flight at DFW the agent informs us the flight is over sold in economy so we inquire about being switched to British Airways on the non-stop to LHR then on-wards to Milan. The AA Agent looks puzzled and quickly said we cannot switch you to BA. At this point we are confused as AA/BA have a tie up we know for a fact Delta can put you on Air France if the flight is over sold. So then we head to JFK with the domestic leg good on a new plane. At the AA terminal 8 at JFK we come to find out the AA lounge coupons given to use are no good but the AA Agent in the lounge makes an exception for the lounge since Christmas is around the corner. Finally we board the AA flight to Milan. Since we own the AA credit card we are allowed to board with Zone 2 but the red jacket agent stops us saying your AA Credit Card is useless and does not work for zone 2. Finally get on the flight and the flight leaves on time. Meals and service were good as AA has to compete with Emirates on this sector but AA really lacks any economy class in flight entertainment. There are no personal TV screens in each seat like Emirates offers. The seats in economy class are too small on AA. Since AA has put TV screens every few rows no one can sleep on this flight as the lighting from the TV screens is very annoying. To end the flight the Breakfast was very good in economy. Overall if AA would match Emirates with proper in flight offering in economy class they would have a good product but till they do this one is better offer taking Emirates if flying to Milan in Economy class.,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,3,Recommendedyes

They don't give priority to board the plane to families with babies nor seniors. Secondly the staff who help you when you are checking in are useless. When you get to the airport you have to check in using their computers but if you are traveling with infants you have to line up for more than an hour. When we lined up an AA employee approached us and confirmed that we were in the right line. One hour later the staff member who was about to help us check in said that we were in the wrong line. Once at the gate they didn't give preference to families with babies. Somebody said through the speaker that there wasn't enough room for our carry-ons and that we had to check them in at no cost. When we approached the staff member at the front desk guy to ask him where to leave the carry on he ignored us. Lastly this airline charges you extra for your luggage.

I would like to give American Airlines a poor review on their performance and customer service we experienced on a flight to Sydney Australia in November 2014. Our flight was delayed leaving MSP partially due to weather but really because they left us sitting on the plane while they delayed the de-icing and then took 45 minutes to do something the pilot said usually takes 15 minutes. We missed our connecting flight in DFW that was to take us to Sydney and the ticket attendants there absolutely refused to re-route us onto several flights that could have taken us to LAX to connect to a flight to SYD that same night. They instead put us on a flight the next day that would re-route us through LAX and on to SYD making us lose an entire day in Australia. The ticket attendants were rude and inconsiderate. I have never had such poor customer service in all my years of flying. DFW said it is a policy not to allow someone on a flight through stand-by if their end destination is international. American Airlines said each airport has their own policy on that and it is not a standard AA policy.

Equipment - 777 300ER (I go out of my way to fly this plane as it is the newest and most comfortable). Business Class. Seats J12 J13 and J14 (window seats). I can't say enough good things about the seat (private and roomy flat bed) the inflight entertainment (15"" screen) and the noise-canceling headphones (sized large enough to surround the ear rather than mashing it as do the headphones on BA). In all instances the food from LAX to LHR was not good and certainly not worth the calories (the same can be said for BA). Better to eat in the Admirals Club Lounge (more on this later). The food from LHR to LAX was much better and excellent on one flight (must have a better kitchen at LHR). The LAX Admirals Lounge is comfortable enough but it is unconscionable that long-haul business class passengers are required to pay for everything beyond bar snacks and coffee. I have never paid for food in the business class lounge of any other comparably-sized airline. And we were mislead (cheated) by one of the wait staff. As an aside BA shares the Admirals Club Lounge in San Diego and as a BA passenger I wasn't charged for food in the lounge there. The LHR Admirals Club Lounge is certainly spartan but well-tended and thankfully much less crowded than the BA lounge. In fact the AA lounge was just about empty on my three visits. Yes the food in the AA lounge is limited compared to BA but at least you don't have to pay extra for it as you do in all of the Admirals Clubs in the USA. Check-in was spotty at best and miserable at worst. At LHR we had to use the check-in desk for coach passengers because there was only one business class desk in operation.

We initially boarded the old rust bucket that is the 767-300 only to be disembarked a couple of hours later due to mechanical problems. They told us mechanics would have the problem fixed in 2 hours only for the inevitable announcement 3 hours later that they couldn't fix the plane and that we would depart the next morning. AA did provide hotels overnight but it was another 2 hour ordeal with 250 passengers lining up to see ONE representative. The next morning we all made our way to the gate boarded the same plane which the captain announced had been fixed and tested and waited for departure. Only we never departed. One hour later the captain announced the plane was STILL not fit to fly to the annoyance of us passengers. We had to wait a further 7 hours at the airport for another AA rust bucket 767 to come save us from London.

Lesson learned and tip: Do everything you can to avoid flying the 767 because chances are you won't be flying. They were good planes back in the 90's and 00's but they're unreliable these days.

I have flown this route with many other airlines in the past and AA was by far my worst experience. Flight left 40 mins late but did make up the time with a tail wind so we arrived on time. Some of the cabin crew were downright surly others were very pleasant. As I can't sleep on planes I rely on watching movies to pass the time but with no in-seat screens there was nothing to watch. I will never fly AA again even if it saves me money.,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,Recommendedno

They also need to train their employees to treat passengers with respect and provide more telephone customer service options that don't leave you waiting 45-51 minutes.

Their standards are poor even from arriving at the boarding gate - why split passengers into groups and then not pay attention to how those groups board the plane? Surely after business class and those with priority shouldn't the next set of passengers to board the plane be those at the rear.

The seats were uncomfortable - 8 hours spent in one of those is not a pleasant experience. We gained the impression that the crew and their requirements over-rode passenger considerations - clearing away too quickly before passengers had time to finish the poor quality meals having to be quiet whilst in the vicinity of sleeping staff and very few drinks/snacks being offered is not what long haul flights should be about.

",American Airlines customer review,M Thompson,United States,17th November 2014,,Paid for F Class JFK-MCO via MIA. AA's JFK Terminal is beautiful. Dedicated F class check in with arrogant staff agents should be mindful of vocal tones and questions. Premium Security line ended up not being during slow time of day as TSA putting 3 non premium bodies to 1 in the same scanner line even though another was available. I purchased a day pass for the Admirals Club as I was quite early for my flight. The JFK Lounge is very nice service was good staff were very kind especially the lady at reception. Purchased a Fruit and Cheese Plate and was surprised in a happy way. Flt to MIA in a 757 intl config. with angle lie flat 2X2 seated at the window. The seats are awkward to get in/out of when upright impossible to escape a window seat with another either sitting or laying down. I tried the angle lie flat position and lasted less than 30 min. in that position simply uncomfortable might as well stand in the galley. The Lay-z-boy option of recline is very nice. PDB was offered no restrictions. Nice looking IFE pity I was never offered headsets to use it. Cocktails with nuts in a bowl served after take off then dinner. AA seems to have downgraded the nut mix with less premium nuts in the mix. The dinner was the biggest shock. The Pre ordered Lasagne was vile and the salad pathetic. Club in Miami is ok with pleasant staff. MIA-MCO in 757 Dom. config. FA's awful on this leg. Airplane broke after we boarded no one seemed to have a clue what to do next. Gate agents and Admirals Club unable to contact ops via phone for updates. No words. Next plane boarded later than promised with no reason offered. Short Flt to MCO uneventful after 2 plus hour delay. There are some things to improve at AA but there is a lot right.,,First Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,5,Recommendedyes

",American Airlines customer review,N Gates,United Kingdom,17th November 2014,,"Based upon our experience of American Airlines' flights from the USA to the UK several years ago and to reduce the effects of jet-lag my wife and I decided to take the daytime flight AA90 which departs Chicago (ORD) at 09.05 and arrives in London (LHR) at 22.45. In retrospect this was a mistake. The Chicago Admiral's Club lounge was most disappointing. Surprisingly no food (unless you paid for it) was available except a few sad-looking bagels and muffins. So we were hungry when the flight took off. We were seated in seats 2A & 2B (the first row on the B767-300ER aircraft) and the seats were comfortable enough with good leg room. However the aircraft was certainly showing its age. In business class (there is no first class on this flight) there are no seat-back screens and the passengers are given small tablets and Bose headphones on which to watch movies. The movie/music selection was poor and was nothing to get excited about. The food that we were served (breakfast and a pre- landing ""snack"") was probably the worst airline food we have ever experienced. It was virtually inedible and it compared extremely unfavourably with the food that we were served in British Airways business class on our flight to the USA three weeks earlier. Furthermore the cabin attendants were virtually invisible. On the eight-hour flight I was never once offered tea or coffee - all I was given was a bottle of water to drink. Two hours before the flight landed in London I had to find a flight attendant and ask for a Bacardi and Coke - no flight attendant ever asked me if I would like something to drink. Unlike British Airways business class on our American Airlines flight we could see no sign of a basket in the kitchen area containing anything to snack on (like bars and sweets). American Airlines do you think that this is acceptable? Just what are business class passengers paying several thousand dollars/pounds over the economy fare for? (You do not arrive any earlier than the people sitting in the back). The food and service we experienced on our flight from ORD to LHR were completely unacceptable and based on our recent experience fear that it will be a very long time before we fly on American Airlines in business class again.",,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,Recommendedno

Flight both ways was on a brand new (you could ""smell"" it was brand new) on an A321 - a plane I'd not heard of - but apparently the ""new"" big brother to the A320. Great plane - in fact I'd say superb. Nice roomy first class that I'd be happy with on a 3-4 hour hour flight. Nice FAs. Plane both ways was rammed from end to end.

First of all the planes wouldn't look out of place in a museum I haven't seen such an antiquated IFE system since the 1990's - suspended CRT monitors and they have the gall to charge nearly $6 a head for headphones. The food is awful with no choice to speak of - breakfast on both flights was a choice between omelette or scrambled egg since my daughter will not eat egg dishes on the outbound flight we asked if they could provide an alternative were curtly told we should have ordered a special diet meal. On the return flight we upset the crew by taking my daughters breakfast on board with us. The final meal - no choice just pizza. On both flights it was served so late that no sooner had we opened our cutlery than we were begin badgered by give up our trays as the crew needed to prepare for landing.

The food wasn't too bad on the way out but if you suffered any dietary requirements it was tough. The flight ran out of certain drinks outbound and on the return journey. On the return journey we were sat at the back and we had to settle for what was left food wise as they'd run out of one of the options.

There was no attempt at any service during this time and the meal and drink were almost flung at us. I don't recall being offered a hot drink! No more service until the snack service which was an undercooked pizza. Pretty basic for a 9 hr day flight the return flight was no better. No drinks were served with breakfast as more turbulence was expected! There was no turbulence - in my opinion the crew didn't leave themselves enough time to carry out a full service.

After flying in circles in the air for half an hour we finally re-routed to land in Little Rock Arkansas. We sat on the runway in the plane for at least two hours with no offerings of good or water even after the 4 hour flight. I understand completely this is weather related and only looking out for our safety however this was not handled well at all. When asking the stewardess for water- it's like it was a huge inconvenience. We finally deboard the plane in Arkansas and were told to wait around to see if the flight is officially cancelled - an hour later it was. Hotel rooms were not offered to be paid for not even a meal or anything at all. Everyone paid out of pocket and waited to de board the next morning. Back at the airport at 6am and we were told to use our old boarding passes and go directly to security- they refused us and made is wait back in the long American Airlines line to get a new boarding pass. My final destination was Austin which was also cancelled. They put me on a flight to Houston in first class which was unexpected. However I decided to just rent a car and drive to Austin from Dallas but I was told that there was no possible way to get my bag because it was listed as priority to Houston. Well our flight from Arkansas to Dallas was delayed an hour then the flight from Dallas to Houston was delayed another hour. First class wasn't anything special honestly more leg room and drinks served in glass instead of plastic. Finally arrive in Houston waiting at baggage claim and guess what - my bag isn't there. I was told it was on the next flight coming in from Dallas which infuriated me after I wanted to originally take my bag in Dallas as it was.

",American Airlines customer review,A Man,United Kingdom,5th October 2014,,Recently flew DUB-ORD - 22 year old 767 ORD-LAX-SFO 737's SFO-LAX-LHR 737 and new 777. Apart from the fact that I got there and back safely I must say what a disappointment the airline is in terms of inflight entertainment comfort staff and food/drinks. I fly regularly from the UK mainly East on EU/Asian airlines or within Europe and I now realise how spoilt we are here. When comparing AA to QR EK etc they just do not compare in any regard. The old 767 aircraft in a very tired state still had analogue buttons for their armrest music entertainment system and huge drop down crt displays. Food was awful and very poor quality on takeoff. The pre-landing snack a deep dish pizza was much better albeit on the greasy side. Domestic US services were on 737's - one with the new sky interior and 2 older interiors. All perfectly fine to get me from point A to B. Plenty of rather expensive food purchase options in the terminals and ability to bring food on board was good. I did not think much of the in- flight food menu for purchase - limited choice and not great quality it would seem. Nice touch for in-flight wi-fi although I didn't use it. The biggest disappointment and a real embarrassment was the supposed 'flagship American service' from LAX-LHR. Super cramped seating in 10 abreast layout in economy meant no elbow room whatsoever. Very poor in-flight entertainment system - hard to navigate difficult to find music titles plus generally limited selection. The catering was shockingly poor for dinner a chicken dish which was flavourless and served with a salad with grated cheese and dressing some crackers with cheese spread a biscuit for dessert and a cold and chewy roll. Breakfast was similarly disappointing and consisted of a yoghurt orange juice and a horrible leathery croissant served with jam and butter. A continental breakfast on a service between the states and the UK? Where is the sausage and eggs? Even Qatar give the above and a hot dish as their breakfast in better quality. The embarrassment really comes with the announcement at the start of the flight where we are introduced and welcomed to their 'flagship' service. It is laughable. On a plus note the drinks service was perfect. Crew were very hit and miss on all sectors. 767 is way above the 777 in terms of comfort and space. I would much rather have 9 abreast in a 777 or a 22 year old 767 then this flagship 777. Good USB/power options though - that's probably the only thing that they got right on AA136. I would go out of my way to avoid AA in future unless price is the only factor.,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,Recommendedno

The interiors were outdated and looked like they had been in use since the 70's the interior was dull and the seats were like something out of a scrap yard mine was actually broken from were the trolleys had banged into it coming down the aisles. None of the economy seats had single televisions which I just could not believe for a long haul flight! Only business class are given portable tablets to watch the entertainment. The food was very poor and tasteless and the flight crew were bickering between themselves from take off to landing.

Also I verified that bathrooms were not cleaned by the staff. Perhaps some disinfecting towels would do passengers can clean the bathrooms by themselves and help with the smell. Anything but making your stomach revolt when having your dinner or breakfast in business class. I sincerely hope that American Airlines replace their aircraft on the MIA-MVD route as soon as possible with more suitable modern aircraft.",,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,Recommendedyes

We were surprised to be automatically allocated leg-room seats by an emergency exit at no extra cost. However we were extremely surprised and disappointed to be on a very old plane (still old logo) and had no personal TV screens for a long haul flight! I have never encountered this before. We could also barely see the shared TV screens. Only one film of two was shown. The air hostesses were distracted tired looking and talking amongst themselves for much of the flight. It felt like an internal AA flight. All the same was exactly true for our return flight but furthermore they could not seat us together on our wedding anniversary. If this is how UK Manchester customers are treated (the same surely can't be true flying out of London!) then prices should reflect the poor service.

I was even more disappointed on the trip back. On the flight from Chicago to London the seats and space were so tight we could barely move. The plane looked old and shabby. It still had those communal TV!. Come on! On a 7-hour flight? Those things were so outdated! The flight from Heathrow was much better. It's the new A380. Still food was not much better.

Since 2000 I have flown with AA more than any other airline racking up nearly 1 million miles most in Economy some in Economy Plus and some in First Class.

Yes it would be nice to get a snack with your beverage like Delta gives but I can bring my own package of cookies or peanuts if I want. And yes the MD-80 aircraft does not have inflight entertainment but they've had powerports on MD80s for a long time and then I've got a fully-charged laptop and smart phone to entertain me. Yes I've run into weather delays in Chicago during the winter which is why I connect through Dallas whenever possible. Yes it would be nice if they would upgrade some of their gate areas with more power plugs and offer their gate agents some sort of incentives to be a little nicer with regular passengers and not just us elite passengers. And yes sometimes they want more money for the same route as a competitor and those are the times I book with another carrier.

This was a last minute change from a ticket on another airline that allows cancellations without penalty because we found our outbound trip to be somewhat stressful. We are delighted we made the change. The one way fare was very reasonable and the service was superior. The SFO to DFW leg was on a wifi equipped 737. We were in seats 3F and 4F and both of us had plenty of legroom and the seats were very comfortable. Entertainment was Rio 2 which we didn't watch because we were reading (and eating). Breakfast for me was granola fruit salad orange juice coffee and a hot biscuit with jam. I am a southern girl and take pride in my own biscuits and I have to say the AA version was excellent. The other choice was a strata with muffin which my husband also found quite tasty the flight attendant passed the muffin/biscuit basket a couple of times but we were too full to partake. At the end of the flight she stopped by each seat and thanked us for flying American. The DFW to SDF leg was on an A312 which was quiet (a little noisy on takeoff) and sturdy. In flight entertainment choice (personal TV) was excellent - many movies TV and music channels to choose from. The snack was also quite good - I had a salad with poached chicken quinoa asparagus and arugula with a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie.

All types of planes to all types of destinations with all types of carriers. The golden years you might say when the flights were not only comfortable but fun and even riotous at times! The service food and drinks (especially the drinks) were an integral and indispensable part of the experience. It is sad to see what was once a wonderful and exciting experience reduced to the level of a bus ride and a damn uncomfortable bus ride at that!

We are mid flight and AA cancels our connection from Dallas to Grand Junction. 10 hours before we are to board. We don't get the notification until we reach our gate to fly to Grand Junction. No effort on AA part at all to help us. No hotel no car service. We make our own arrangements. This may seem small but by this point we are exhausted. Any help at all by AA would have been appreciated. Our return trip. I went for more water I was told they only had the large bottles.

The hard product is outstanding in terms of privacy comfort and durability. Feels very exclusive and closer to the luxury that Asian and some European carriers are offering in long haul configurations. Outbound check-in was prompt although not very helpful with navigating the chaos that was security at JFK T8. Onboard service was exceedingly professional albeit not intrusive but that's the way I like it. Purser kept a watchful eye on the 10 pax in the cabin and was very prompt with drink refills or any other needs. Food was above expectations and in fact quite tasty. Could have a better champagne for first class (it is in fact not a real champagne but a domestic sparkling wine) but that's a first world problem of course. Pillow and blanket provided were of good quality could use a mattress pad for overnight flights. On the return check in at LAX Flagship was quick and friendly brought to the front of the security line which was nice. Can't comment on onboard service on the return because once we hit 10000 feet I put the seat into bed mode and slept a complete four and a half hours of solid sleep waking just before descent. This is a first for me in over 25 years of travel. For that reason alone I fully commend this product. It's a game changer for the NY-LA market.,,First Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,Recommendedyes

I cannot believe that American Airlines is part of the One World Alliance. When you look at the level of service you get from world class airlines like Qantas Cathay Pacific and LAN and then see the pathetic offering you get from AA I am dumbstruck. As a frequent Australian traveller I absolutely hate having to use AA anytime. Their Admirals Club lounges are truly pathetic - paying for food and pseudo-snacks like pretzels and plastic wrapped muffins. AA passengers who fly Qantas and use the Qantas Club lounges must be amazed. The service on AA is uniformly awful and rude. How can Americans put up with such an array of shocking airline companies.

I spent the next few hours on hold with customer service trying to get my flight rebooked.

The next morning unable once again to contact customer service I boarded the flight and made it home in time to return to work. Only after I finally contacted customer service did I learn that I had in fact been booked on a rescheduled flight. I searched my inbox spam and trash but had received no sort of email or notification of the rescheduling.

",American Airlines customer review,John Parsons,United States,31st July 2014,,DFW to PDX - the service was terrible. First the price: it was $360 round-trip non-stop. While this may sound like a good deal it was not too long ago that American wanted $500 for the same trip. I could go to Europe one- way for that! The price drop is the only reason why I give them 2 out of 5 stars for value. If it weren't for that I would give them one-star without a second thought. Second the lines for baggage check were long. Apparently this airline does not realize that it's 2014: I was completely unable to pay my baggage fee online and there was no fast check-in option either. So I had to wait in line to do something I could have done online with other air carriers and only takes five minutes at most with other ones. Third the seats. They were harder than rocks with virtually no leg room with my messenger bag below the seat in front of me. It was virtually impossible to sleep or rest in my seat. When I got off the plane I was very sore. The flight attendants did not care about my experience and the check-in agents flat out ignored me at PDX. Lastly when I emailed American with a complaint about these issues I got the most sarcastic response I have ever got from a customer service representative.

On a recent trip from LGA to DFW AA forced me to gate- check my same standard 22in. carry-on bag which I take on every flight on every other airline. The bag clearly fit within the test box when I had to test it the first time going through the security checkpoint and similarly fit again when forced to test it at the gate but because the agent said I had to ""push"" it down to fit within the box it was too big and had to be checked. When I boarded the plane I was frustrated to see that the bag would have easily fit within the overhead compartment.

En route two of my three flights were delayed almost causing me to miss a connection and my baggage was lost - not sure if by American or one of the affiliated carriers. The worst was yet to come however. My flight from Madrid to NYC was delayed by a couple hours and so I was rebooked for my connecting flight. I wish I'd insisted on catching it since it was delayed anyway because what transpired after was unbelievable. The rebooked flight to DC was eventually canceled. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours as maintenance repaired a broken chair then a door and then we lost our slot in the queue and had to wait awhile and then my home airport suspended flights coming and going due to weather. Finally the pilot took us back to the gate and told us our flight was canceled. 4 hours on the tarmac that day. Service to rebook flights was slow and some agents were a bit snippy. Slept at the gate overnight for my early flight the next morning. Had a bad feeling when I saw people arriving through the same gate 15 minutes prior to our scheduled boarding time. Sure enough we sat there for well over an hour as the tyre on the plane was being changed and then the flight was canceled. Exasperated I asked for a flight out of LaGuardia instead and although it was delayed on the runway I eventually got home after four bookings from NYC to DC. Very tight seat arrangement on the planes flying back (because they were older). Food wasn't bad and service on all the planes was overall pretty good. Service at the gate ranged from very solicitous to brusque. The airline seems to schedule flights too close together. On top of that the planes on my return trip were all old and shoddy hence the delays. So I ended up being booked for eight flights round trip when I was originally scheduled for just five. Seven of eight were delayed and two of those led to cancellations. American didn't do much to compensate me for the inconvenience either.

All 4 planes were MD-80's - I probably don't need to say much more. These planes should have been taken out of service 10 years ago. I was flying them in the early 90's from ORD to LAX they needed to be retired back then. All 4 flights were delayed because of mechanical problems (ranging from inoperative toilets to loose electrical panels). All 4 planes were filthy - not just the rest rooms and aisles - but the seats windows and tray tables were disgusting. All 4 flights were full - so as we sat on the planes waiting for the ""maintenance issues"" to be resolved we roasted. Given that I had a similar experience on a trip from Palm Springs to Cleveland (round trip 4 flight segments) in April on American I should have known better. But as a ""loyal rewards member"" I booked this last flight on American too - hoping for better equipment and on time service. At this point I don't even expect any aspect of comfort on American flights - I just want a safe plane that lands reasonably on time. Given the last 8 flights that I flew on American planes in the last 90 days I'm not even certain that the old MD-80's are safe anymore.

No pre-board because ""there are too many children on this flight"" and they took her stroller away so that she had to carry 2 bags and the child. On one leg of the flight they gave her back the stroller last and nearly made her miss her connection. There is no compassion from this airline!",,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,Recommendedno

",American Airlines customer review,D Graubard,United States,8th July 2014,,ORD-JFK/LGA-ORD - July 2-5. I keep seeing a huge increase in great attitudes from flight attendants on AA flights. Very personable and fun on both flights. Departed ORD on-time and landed at JFK early - but taxied around JFK for 30 minutes before getting to our gate. Dinner served was pre-ordered on aa.com and the chicken was very tasty. Return to ORD from LGA - plane was only 60% full and the three flight attendants (DCA-based) were having a great time with everyone. Lots of talking laughing with passengers and very personable. Good dinner served and landed 40 minutes early into ORD. I see a lot of negative reports for AA but I wonder if people are just expecting too much or are exaggerating their issues.

",American Airlines customer review,Pam Gould,United States,8th July 2014,,One month travel itinerary June 10 - July 8. Point here is not as much about inconvenience as how situations are handled. 4 flights cancelled. One due to weather. Paid upgrades are not refunded if flights cancelled per AA reservations. After 3.5 hour wait little or no information given to waiting passengers in cancellation of first leg OGG-LAX. Restaurant employees saw flight crew leave airport. AA would only help passengers with connections. The rest of us scrambled for flights. Locating luggage was a whole other mishap. 2.5 hr flight from QRO-DFW turned into a 10 hour flight touching down in 2 cities to refuel. Water was being rationed. Children first. No food. No offers from ground crews for additional water or even peanuts. No help with connecting flights. No enough cots in airport Terribly mishandled. Connecting flight missed but cancelled anyway. MCI-OGG delayed 4 hours. Equipment not available. Automated message via phone at 2.30 am for 7.30 am flight. Was auto rebooked on flight out a day later. Called and obtained same day departure. Hoping I get out. Remember when flying used to be fun and airlines treated us with courtesy?

We arrived early as were told to do. Eventually we found that there was a delay of at least 30 minutes. The delay continued to be extended and ended up being a 9 hour wait. AA reps told us there was nothing they could do. The seats are firm plastic with no head rest or place to lean against the wall. We were given a lunch voucher which we used but were never offered a dinner voucher. We became more and more frustrated as time progressed. We finally left for a long flight to Maui with a crew who were unhappy to called out on Father's Day on an unexpected flight. Their attitude reflected that. We were not given anything to compensate for all our problems no free drinks no food. Nothing. We got to our hotel at 3.30 am. On our trip home we were held up because someone had thrown up in the seat but it wasn't cleaned up by the cleaning crew. There was vomit on the seats and in the buckle making it necessary to take off all seat covering and taking out and putting in all new seatbelt apparatus.

I had no option to talk to anyone or hear a reasoning on the scenario that was taking place. I had to call back and go through various automated conversations until I finally reached someone. After explaining the situation (and no sympathy was shown) I realized the person could not help me and did not desire to help me. Little did she know I had major wedding events to get to at my destination (hints why I booked an early flight in the first place).

On the date of departure we received an automated phone call 3 hours before take off notifying us that our plane was delayed 4 hours. This interfered with our connecting flight and there was not another flight that would have us reaching our destination until the next day. I contacted the airline immediately and they confirmed that if they re-routed us we could reach our destination. We agreed to this and proceeded to the airport. Upon arrival we were unable to check in. An hour later it was discovered that when re-routing us the person had neglected to issue us a ticket and now our flight was over booked. Our only option was to drive 2.5 hours to another airport catch a flight there and then have 15 minutes between connecting flights that we were to try and get to the gate and board in time. Somehow we managed to make it and made it to our destination. On our return trip we again couldn't check in and had to see an attendant. Everyone we encountered was extremely rude and hateful.

Main cabin extra is excellent and as my husband is a permanent gold card holder we were able to select these at no extra cost. The seats are wider and very comfortable. The extra legroom is a bonus. Everything else is as in economy. The IFE on the -300 is very swish with a large screen and huge content a marked improvement over the -200 and the 767. I've always found that if you are nice to the staff they are nice in return and this was the case on this flight.

When I selected the option to check-in I was asked if I wanted to select a seat. I elected yes and was presented which several options for only 'Paid Seats' at $86/per seat. Thinking there were no other options I selected a seat and paid the $86 for both the departing and return trips. After making and paying $172 for seats the web site asked if I wanted my boarding pass. I said yes and I was offered the option for seat selections that required no extra fee. Feeling set-up wondering why I was not offered options for all available seats from the beginning I called the AA Customer service group and the agent informed me that they could not do anything about changing my seat to one that did not require an extra fee. I then wrote them to ask why I was lead into believing I could only purchase a seat when free seats were available they simply said 'you made the decision to purchase the seat and therefore there is nothing that can do'. After this frustrating experience on the outbound flight I requested a 'bloody mary mix' just after the stewardess handed one to the stewardess covering the first class group. I was informed that they no longer had any more. Things on the return flight were equally as bad. I was unable to print a boarding pass - web message said my reservation had been cancelled.

Our flight didn't have enough upgrades available for both of us but she checked the next flight and found two. We paid a small extra charge to change flights in addition to the usual miles and co-pay but well worth it. We were originally returning on the -300 so a bit disappointed. The 2-3-2 configuration is now old hat as are the seats. American made a big mistake not going for fully flat bed seats when they bought the -200 and the angle flat seats are very out of date. Having said that they were very comfortable with huge legroom. The angle is not as bad as some I've been on though and I managed several hours sleep overnight. Lots of space and a bit of room for your bits and pieces. Service was rushed on takeoff which I assume was because the flight left at 21.20 and they wanted to allow everyone to sleep as soon as possible. Lights were out before we asked for coffee and cognac but staff willing to continue serving us as long as were wanted. Staff were visible all night as far as I could see. Be nice to the staff and they will usually be nice to you. Almost always works as it did on this flight. Food was only average certainly not what I expect for business class - grossly overcooked steak destroyed broccoli thing and something else I couldn't identify. Breakfast was a lovely omelette but it came with another grossly overcooked and dry bit of steak. It was all well presented and served however with good crockery flatware and glass wine glasses. Interesting that they did trolley service rather than tray service I have previously had on American. IFE on the -200 is dated with a reasonable screen size but limited selection of movies. It broke down at the beginning of the flight and it took a very long reboot to get it going. Certainly not up to the standard on the -300. Bose noise-reducing headphones a great idea but they are collected an hour before landing. The map feature showing flight progress etc didn't work for the entire flight. American is not trying to be one of the significantly better Asian or Mid East airlines so don't expect it to be. Keep expectations reasonable and you will likely enjoy the flight.

Business check-in at American's terminal at LAX is a joke. 1 person to check in everyone while 2 customer service agents hang around telling us 'they're going as fast as they can'. Security was in a tiny airless room - I couldn't quite believe this was the entrance to the terminal. Once through we passed the main spacious security check-in - it was closed. At the Admirals Club things started to look up: it's large with friendly bartenders and table service for drinks. Surprised to be restricted to 2 drinks coupons though. I'm guessing it's because there are domestic passengers in the lounge too. The plane was at a remote stand so we had to take a bus out to it - this surprises me as you would have thought that LAX-LHR was a premium route and American would want to encourage passengers. On board the cabin in business class on the 777-300 is exceptional - probably best across the Atlantic. Huge seats comfy flat bed great IFE plenty of drinks and ok food. Cabin crew friendly enough. Easy to sleep on this plane. There was a delay due to a sick passenger on the incoming flight and then a minor maintenance issue - all the movies were on so we drank and watched films.

The most startling aspect to flying with American Airlines was the rudeness of the staff! I went to the toilet and an exiting a member of staff had started serving lunch she kept shouting at me to not stand close to her (which I was not) and in the end marched me to my seat and demanded I ""sit now"".

",American Airlines customer review,M Comfort,United States,4th June 2014,,LAX to Phoenix. We were really unhappy with the customer service of American Airlines employees at LAX. We had a flight coming into LAX run really late and were bumped to a later flight the next day. We arrived to the airport at 8.00 and our flight to Phoenix was departing at 9.25. I usually arrive to airports about 1.5 hours before a domestic flight and this is usually plenty of time. We checked in at the kiosk but the computer would not print the bag tags. We grabbed an airline employee who directed us to a baggage check line for others with issues with the printing. It was only four people deep so we were not too worried. After about 20 minutes and the line had barely moved we started to become nervous. We tried talking to a couple agents about taking our bags from us and sticking them on a later flight so we could still make it to our gate. They were all at the most apathetic and kept telling us there was nothing they could do. By the time we finally got to the counter we had been in line 45 minutes. There were two employees working this whole time even though the process seemed to be incredibly slow. This inefficient system and lacking customer service caused us to miss our flight. Maybe I would think this was normal airline behavior but we have flown with Alaskan airlines in LAX when a connecting flight caused us to come in late. Their employees were very helpful took our bags and sent them on a later flight and even pushed us through security to ensure we made the plane. In the end I will never chose American again if I can help it.,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,Recommendedno

We waited on the runway for 1.5 hours because of ""weather"" (even though other flights on the same route were taking off) then told we had to go back to the gate. One flight attendant then got into a screaming match with a passenger (extremely unprofessional) while I waited with an upset baby for 15 minutes in the roasting hot gangway because they couldn't find anyone to bring up the gate-checked strollers. Finally the ""weather"" was okay to allow us to leave but a new crew was needed we finally left around 11.30pm. And then because LGA was closed it landed at JFK instead.

We did this and when it came to finalising the check-in the system cancelled our check-in.

Went to the counter and by the time we had got through the queue we were 3 mins past our check-in time.

",American Airlines customer review,S Metrie,Canada,20th May 2014,,"We flew Toronto to Chicago; paid almost $700 per ticket which was very expensive considering it was an 1.5 hour flight. When we booked the flight we thought it was through WestJet as it was advertised that way but in small writing at the bottom it said operated by American Airlines which we didn't see when we booked the flight otherwise we wouldn't have booked it. We had a very bad experience with AA a few years ago and refused to book any more flights with them. This time both flights were delayed. When returning they had oversold so my sister and I volunteered to take a later flight. That wasn't the issue. The issue was the incompetence of the staff; it took them an hour and a half to figure out how to give us our vouchers which is ridiculous because they told us we couldn't leave the gate until they gave us the voucher so we couldn't even go and have dinner or anything. On top of that the rep there kept saying she had no idea what she was doing and this was her first time doing vouchers - then get someone who knows what they're doing rather than wasting an hour just trying to figure it out yourself doesn't give us a lot of confidence in your abilities. Other issue was that they kept changing the gate to the flight (it was changed 4 times no exaggeration) and when we would go up to the desk to make sure it was there every person at the desk was extremely rude and one actually said to us ""can't you read the monitor?"" and when we explained that our ticket had a different number than what was on the monitor they gave us a dirty look and said that what they had was right (it wasn't in the end which is pathetic). it would be nice that if you were going to change the gates; at least inform people and let them know. Another minor thing was with the flight attendant she was grabbing something from the bin above my sister and her bag kept hitting my sister's head several times; and she wouldn't even apologize even though she saw it happening; she just gave us a look like how dare you sit there and be in my way when she was the one who was in our way.

",American Airlines customer review,J Van Der Merwe,United Kingdom,11th May 2014,,We took this airline from Raleigh to London because we expected a similar service to BA with which it codeshares. Unfortunately we were so wrong! There is firstly no modern inflight entertainment system for economy class and the food was dreadful. Onboard service was rushed and not very friendly and to top it all we had one of the flight attendants talking loudly with passengers at the back throughout the whole night. Of course that meant that even without entertainment there was also no sleeping for those of us unlucky enough to be in this attendant's vicinity.,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,Recommendedno

Check in was efficient and friendly and the flight was uneventful except for the crew who made the whole experience feel very uncomfortable. I have never experienced cabin crew like it. Its a given that everyone has an off day once and a while but some of the crews interactions with the passengers that I witnessed were uncalled for. Crew were short unfriendly disinterested and deliberately ignored some passengers. At one stage I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience when I asked for a paper towel to dry up some water I accidentally spilled. In the end I had to queue at the toilets as I was informed I was capable of getting my own towels as the crew were busy. When we landed and were disembarking the crew thanked me for flying the New American Airlines. I don't know why BA codeshare with this airline as the service standards are at complete opposites of the scale. When I book my next flight I will make sure I know what airline I'm flying so I'm not on a code share with AA.,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,Recommendedno

I arrived in LA this morning by Qantas from Perth-Sydney and upon going through the ""Express Connection"" I was informed by one of the ground crew members that I would be required to take my luggage and check-in inside the terminal. When I arrived in the terminal I was sent by American Airlines employees to 3 different places to try to drop-in my baggage. When I finally arrived in the last spot (45 min prior to flight schedule time) I was informed that I wouldn't be able to check-in my bags nor take them in the cabin despite having had checked-in on-line prior to going to the airport. She them put my wife and me in ""stand-by"" list for a flight 2 hours later and checked our bags-in. I was placed in second in the list at that moment (again according to the front desk lady because I am a ""One World Sapphire Member"" and would be put in front of other people in similar situations. In the half hour preceding the boarding time our name had escalated to 6th and 7th on the list. I tried to (very politely) speak with the lady at the boarding desk 3 times but she in each time she rudely answered ""Stand-by I will be with you in a second!"" In the end she suggested that one of us should take a remaining seat and the other wait for the next flight. We decided to do that as the next flight seat wouldn't be warrant as well. Everything was dealt in a rush/unplanned manner showing AA have no control to handle such situations. Now I am here hoping to not get bumped again or get stuck in LA for the night after 16 hrs flying from Australia then meet my wife at my destination and go to the hotel to have a rest.

The most senior of the crew had an abrupt manner I noticed on more than one occasion her behaviour towards passengers who accidentally happened to get in her way in the galley area there was no politeness shown in terms of politely asking them to move but eye rolling and heavy sighing. My pillow happened to fall into aisle without my knowledge and I was reprimanded by this senior crew member for allowing this to happen! The crew whilst serving beverages/food would not engage in any conversation or pleasantries with passengers instead they would look right through you if you smiled at them they would not smile back when I exited the economy area on leaving the plane a couple of the crew stood near the exit area and there was again no pleasantries or smiles just silence. Only on leaving the plane did a friendly crew member who I believe had been working in First Class or Business Class speak to me and said 'thanks for flying with us have a good day'. I have flown with many airlines and I have to say that my return flight home with AA was the worst experience I have ever known and because of this I will not be flying with AA again.

The crew of flight attendants and pilots were nothing great flight attendants didn't give much personal attention to the passengers it seemed. We were seated in Main Cabin Extra in the front row (8A8B8C). Main Cabin Extra is supposed to have 6 inches of extra legroom since we were seated in the front with the bulkhead in front of us which is really just a wall for those of you who don't know it did not feel like we had 6 inches of legroom and it felt very cramped through the whole area. If you are about to pay extra money for main cabin extra avoid the first rows which is row 8. I'm not sure about 8D 8E 8F but I assume it's the same. Also the tray tables are considerably smaller because they are stowed in the arm rest. But they are kind of cool to an airline enthusiast like myself because it feels like a first class seat. We did not have to pay for Main Cabin Extra because my family had Gold member free Main Cabin Extra so for us it didn't matter but if you have to pay for MCE I would sit any row behind 8.

When we checked in at the desk however we were told we couldn't have the seats we'd booked and were given 5 others which were a 2 and a 3. During the second leg of the trip we were given exit seats which were not allowed for children as we were told they would be 'a good bargaining tool' for swaps. On the return we couldn't sit at all near each other: 3 of us sat on the very back row and 2 at the front of the plane. However AA used BA as a carrier for the final leg - they had automatically allocated five seats together because we were travelling with children and allowed us onto the plane first - a completely different attitude from AA.

",American Airlines customer review,D Jones,,7th April 2014,,"Have lived outside the US for 20+ years. Have flown many long haul flights to European hubs and then on to different cities in the US. We usually fly on British Airways (great airline) or KLM or Delta. For the first time was forced (because of a change in flight schedules) to fly on American Airlines from DFW to London (Heathrow) yesterday. So many things wrong: seatbelt sign on for most of the flight despite only occasional mild turbulence. Not acceptable on a 9 hour flight. The flight attendants were not friendly or service oriented. They mostly communicated with each other and acted annoyed when interacting with passengers. or they just sat in the galley. On this long flight a request for another small bottle of water (in business class) was denied: ""Only one per customer"". They did not come around even once during the night to offer drinks. Unless there is no other choice avoid long-haul trips on this airline. The ground staff were a little better still not customer oriented.",,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,Recommendedno

",American Airlines customer review,E Moya,United States,7th April 2014,,My husband and I have been trying to get home since 4/6/2014 we were booked on a flight at 4.10 after a one hour delay they cancelled it. We couldn't get booked on another flight so we had to stay over. They booked us on flight #2575 at 9.25 then overnight somehow we got cancelled even though we had recheck boarding passes. We were re- booked for a noon flight #2419. Then after being directed to 2 different gates and waiting in the airport for over 12 hours today 4/7/2014 our flights to Albuquerque were canceled. We were sent to 5 different gates during the 12 hours. 3 cancellations in 24 hours it's unacceptable customer service. We still don't know if we're actually going to have a plane at 8.20 flight #1285.,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,Recommendedno

",American Airlines customer review,Randi Hathaway,United States,6th April 2014,,My husband and I were on flight 2224 from Las Vegas on April 4. The airplane was an S-80. We flew first class and were very disappointed. The only difference between first and the rest of the plane was a wider seat and meal. The plane didn't have movies or music. Bare bones plane for sure. Also a constant stream of people walking from the back of the plane to use front lavatory. Also alcohol is plentiful if you drink however I wanted ice tea and that is not an option. Maybe they don't know that it is available in bottles or cans.,,First Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,Recommendedno

",American Airlines customer review,D Graubard,United States,6th April 2014,,AA997 DFW-EZE on 4 April - First Class. Overall a great experience. The purser was very personable and professional. 777-200 plane which has seen better days - for a first class seat (that I will say was super comfortable to sleep in as it was totally flat and they give you a thin mattress which makes it much better) there were so many little tears and things that made the seat look tatty. Food was good - appetizer soup (great pumpkin soup) salad chicken and veggies and desert. In-flight TV on AA is always a joke compared to any other carrier - too few TV shows - too few updated recent movies - super small screen for a first class experience. But for the price and the overall service - AA wins on this flight. I have recently had a lot of flights and AA has been doing great. Keep up the great work!,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,Recommendedyes

",American Airlines customer review,Stephanie Curl,United States,4th April 2014,,We flew in from Jamaica to Dallas Fort Worth Texas and our flight was delayed. The biggest problem was that there was little information given to passengers. After 2 hours we found out we were waiting for a crew to arrive from another destination. After being delayed 4 hours we finally got on the plane to sit on the runway for another 45 minutes. The pilot said we were being re-routed due to weather and did not have enough fuel and would have to go back to the gate to refuel. We reach the gate at 2am and wait to only be told the flight was now cancelled. This is where I truly get frustrated with the way things were handled. 150+ passengers are told their flight is cancelled but there is no other flights going into Louisville. You will have to find another way home or wait until Wednesday (6 days later)! We wait in line another 1.5 hrs to try and find a flight close to home willing to drive the rest of the way. The gate agents have been no help whatsoever it was 5.30 in the morning and they offered no cots or anything to us. There were no hotel rooms. They did give us a $12 voucher for a meal. Finally got a late flight almost 24 hours later to Cincinnati but now have to incur additional expense of renting a car to get home. Tried to get on a couple of standby flights but I have noticed that AA overbooked every flight and boots people off so stand by is a joke. Highly disappointed!,,Economy Class,,,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1,Recommendedno

",American Airlines customer review,B Kelley,United States,3rd April 2014,,Paid $1700 for two seats. Airline website would not allow us to choose seats at time of booking. Return a week later to book and lo and behold only paid seats left. Call Airline and told unless we pay and additional $170 per person we will have to depend on the kindness of others to move seats so we can sit together. This is absolute crap. If you can't book your seats at time of booking then don't buy the ticket unless you're willing to pay additional $$$ to actually get a seat.,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,Recommendedno

",American Airlines customer review,Alan Bartz,Germany,3rd April 2014,,We flew from MCO via MIA to Punta Cana. The first leg was fine and for an hours flight every was completely satisfying. The second leg from Miami to Punta Cana was a total disappointment for my first international flight with AA. At the airport I was rejected to enter the lounge as for flights to The Caribbean the access is excluded. This logic I will never understand. The two flight attendants have been absolutely passive in their service and spent their time rather with making jokes with each other or actively ignoring requests such as a glass of water or getting visa documents. One flight attendant had his hands in his pockets at all times - while going through the aisle. I have never been so disappointed from a Business Class flight before. For sure AA will not have me as a customer onboard again and I am glad that there are a lot of options on the US flight market.,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,Recommendedno

",American Airlines customer review,M Thompson,United States,2nd April 2014,,AA 324 MCO-DFW in First. Flight on time pre-ordered snack delivered cheerfully pre-departure drinks offered. Inflight the Attendant could not do enough for everyone. Ordered 5 star connecting service and arrival service. Was met at the arriving gate at DFW and taken by golf cart to the Admirals Club in Concourse D. I was able to bypass the Admirals club check in line handed Premium Drink vouchers and told I would be greeted by someone else to take me to my next flight. Shortly afterward the weather turned horrible for about an hour. My new 5 star agent found me in the Admirals Club and asked if I had any questions. I had her check to make sure the plane taking me to Santiago Chile made it on the ground. She came back to confirm it was on the ground but waiting for a gate due to the weather. Near boarding time she collected me and carted me off to the gate. I was carted back to the Admirals Club and asked to be kept informed of the situation. I was collected again and informed the new plane was ready but they were under tight time constraints to get it going due to crew time restraints. AA's Flagship suite is comfortable the turn down service pyjamas slippers and kit were all very nice. The international crew in First save for one employee were polite but simply went through the motions. The food was decent. Filled out the Breakfast Card and awoke to a nice breakfast and a wonderful view of the Andes as the sun was rising. Despite the Delay in DFW good job by AA.,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,Recommendedyes

",American Airlines customer review,M Thompson,United States,2nd April 2014,,"I arrived 4 hours early for my late afternoon flight to Orlando after my cruise. I was confirmed in Main Cabin Extra. Miami has always been a ""challenging"" airport but not having been there in over a decade it was a whole new challenge. My bag was 5 lbs overweight so I had to go buy a small personal carry item and remove 5 lbs from my bag. Needless to say a huge hassle. Since I checked in so early American did not offer to put me on one of the several flight before mine but they certainly did send my bag early as it was already in this huge mire when I arrived in Orlando. The security situation in Miami is a nightmare. Once finally through the drama the new terminal AA built was nice with allot more choices of things to do but it seemed gate after gate I passed no one cleaned up the trash left by the customers. Flight boarded on time I asked for some tissue got it promptly then only saw the Flight attendants during seat belt check before and take off and landing. They all seemed to pile into F class and offer multiple drink rounds. Main Cabin Extra is what AA Coach used to be minus the service. We arrived on time and my bag had been waiting hours for me.

",American Airlines customer review,R Vines,United Kingdom,2nd April 2014,,I hadn't flown American since the mid-80s when the service varied between passive-aggressive and actively unpleasant. Things have improved since then. The service on two flights - business from Miami to San Jose and economy from Panama City to Miami - was fine and even friendly.

",American Airlines customer review,O Thompson,United States,31st March 2014,,6 flights with AA in the past month or two. JFK-MIA: Arrived at check-in counter on time. Staff were friendly enough and seemed to be at ease but maintained proper professionalism. Flight waited 20 minutes at the gate before taxiing because of some missing passengers. Nice well maintained 757 seats were comfortable although not the best and flight attendants were nice. Rather bad entertainment. 2 hour flight landed in Miami with no issues. MIA-MGA (Nicaragua): Had roughly a 2 hour layover until connecting flight was scheduled. Everything went smoothly no complaints there. Flight into Managua was a little worse - 757 was a bit dilapidated and we had about an hour delay before taking off. Staff at the gate upon landing pointed us towards our destination and were very welcoming. MGA-MIA-JFK: Return flight went well nothing really remarkable. Everything was on time staff were nice and helpful seats were alright. JFK-LHR: On one of the older 777-200ER aircraft. Staff very friendly and professional. One of the flight attendants even went as far as to sit down and conduct conversation with a few of the passengers during the flight and gave off a very good vibe. Throughout the 6 hour flight the flight the attendants came around frequently and often were available to provide passengers with snacks and drinks whenever prompted. Seats were surprisingly comfortable and the flight wasn't even half full so almost everyone in Economy had the chance to fully recline across the 5 seat middle aisle (One of the advantages of the 200ER over the 300ER). Meals were actually pretty decent and I had few complaints. Fairly good entertainment with a selection of about 30 films and 10 TV shows. Flight landed smoothly and we were quickly on our way through customs and security. LHR-JFK: The flight was a little more crowded but there was still room to switch seats and there were a few open middle aisles to lie down on. Lunch was a small pizza which wasn't too bad. Flight landed smoothly and there were staff at the door to greet us. Would fly again.,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,Recommendedyes
